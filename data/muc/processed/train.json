{"docid": "DEV-MUC3-0004", "doctext": "goodbye (air force commander) general rafael bustillo, false hope for mass killers.  gen.  bustillo resigns or is made to resign as the air force chief.  because of this, the general is admitting that without the bombing on san salvador's neighborhoods the fmln (farabundo marti national liberation front) would have defeated the salvadoran armed forces.  bustillo's resignation is yet another sign of the failure of 10 years of the u.s. counterinsurgency policy in el salvador, as became clear with the offensive launched on 10 november.    for 10 years the military and their u.s. sponsors based their trust in the air power to drown in blood the aspiration of the nation to achieve democracy and social justice.  this first happened in the interior of the country, with the destruction of dozens of towns like tenancingo, berlin, torola, san fernando, and so many others that took place along with the genocide carried out by the infantry with the mass murders of civilians in el mosoto, sunpul, and ocotapayo.  bustillo is leaving as so many generals and u.s. ambassadors have.  and like all of them his departure reveals the imperialist power's failure to consolidate its counterinsurgency program in el salvador.    as all the others who have left, bustillo also seeks excuses in the face of his failure, by accusing others.  he accuses (former defense minister eugenio) vides casanova of being soft in fighting the people's plan.  one would have to ask bustillo if the air force, of which he represented its most encouraging pillar, was soft when it murdered 70,000 salvadorans, monsignor arnulfo romero and the jesuit priests included, and even when it murdered patriot officers of that same army.  was the u.s. pentagon soft when it gave $3 billion, weapons, and bombs for the most cowardly act of genocide latin america can recall this century?    the u.s. strategy, implemented through the top military command in the past 10 years with all its might did all it could so that the permanent rebellion in the rural areas reached the country's vital centers, as indeed happened as of the 10 november offensive.  bustillo states it clearly.    the bombing temporarily halted the defeat of the top command.  through an act of genocide, it managed to remove the disgruntled people from the neighborhoods where the guerrilla forces were.  bustillo acknowledges genocide is the sole way the armed forces can survive.  bustillo acknowledges the fmln's strength and therefore urges the armed forces to be tougher and inflexible and rejects a political solution to the conflict.  a political solution would express the consensus among the country's major sectors.  obviously the top command represents a decadent minority. bustillo supports launching a fascist crusade against the people's wish for democracy.  in this effort, he lashes out at the catholic church, all opposition sectors that report human rights violations, and all sectors that support democratizing the country.  in conclusion, we say that bustillo is not resigning of his own volition.  the fmln action eliminated bustillo as it eliminated garcia, vides, and so many other military chiefs who left their posts without fulfilling the task commissioned by the united states: to stop the fmln.    the fmln offensive bared the genocidal, antipopular, and fascist nature of the alfredo cristiani regime to such an extent that it prompted a strong debate in the united states on cutting military aid.  the jesuits' murders and the bombings so shook the international community that it is pressuring for punishment of the officers involved in these incidents.  however, the bush administration accepted this, since colonel rene emilio ponce (chairman of the joints chiefs of staff) and his clique, even cristiani, must shoulder this responsibility.  we must not forget that in costa rica the salvadoran defense minister disclosed cristiani authorized the bombings.    bush needed a scapegoat to place it on the altar of the debates which will begin in the u.s. congress on the fate of military aid.  bustillo is bush's scapegoat.  however, bustillo was already a useless element of the murderous machinery that remains active.  will the u.s. public and congress be appeased with this foul tasting candy?  time and the spirit of the times are obviously running against the fascist program in el salvador.  while peoples of the world tear down dogmas, dictatorships, and walls, bustillo, who leaves through the door of defeat, asks the armed forces to be tougher, commit more genocide, and build more walls of repression against the church, the people, and the nation as a whole.  goodbye, gen. bustillo.  we continue writing history without you.  the decade we begin is of democracy, independence, and self-determination.  that is why foreign intervention and the walls of intolerance have a short life span in this country, where the people grow in heroism and the struggle for social change is not deterred by bombings.", "extracts": {"PerpInd": [], "PerpOrg": [[["air force", 9]]], "Target": [], "Victim": [[["arnulfo romero", 1596]]], "Weapon": []}}

{"docid": "DEV-MUC3-0022", "doctext": "the farabundo marti national liberation front (fmln) has described the arrest of five soldiers accused of committing the massacre (of six jesuit priests) as \"a manipulated cover operation.\" basically, cristiani is alleged to have decided to punish a number of low-ranking officers to close the case as quickly as possible and to end international pressures.  what is your opinion in this regard?    (zamora) the fact that president cristiani acknowledges that members of the army were responsible for the massacre is a first step and definitely a good thing, but it is entirely insufficient unless the subsequent steps are also taken.  first, to identify who the responsible parties were:  this is the first important point, because nobody can feel satisfied if only low-ranking officers are identified.  such an act can only have been ordered by high-ranking officers.  we must not forget the murder of monsignor romero, for which there were no sentences and no trials.    (oppes) however, the armed forces high command immediately denied involvement in the operation, stating that it was an isolated action \"divorced from any institutional policy.\"    (zamora) i believe this is entirely wrong: the murder of the jesuit fathers cannot be considered an isolated action.  over 7,000 people have died in el salvador during 10 years of civil war, and 90 percent of them were civilians.  political assassination by the government forces is a constant practice.  furthermore, torture is regularly practised in el salvador.  the army high command cannot fail to know this.  they cannot claim to be innocent, because they have the greatest responsibilities for human rights violations.    (oppes) yet last month the summit of central american heads of state in san jose ended with a success for president cristiani, who secured an explicit condemnation of the offensive launched by the guerrillas in november, whereas no specific charges were leveled at the government for human rights violations.    (zamora) there is a positive factor that should be borne in mind, namely, the call from the five presidents for a resumption of the dialogue in el salvador and the appeal to the un secretary general to carry out mediation to this end.  but in the summit's final document, it is the fmln and the nicaraguan contras who pay the price for the agreement among the presidents: these are diplomatic games that do not facilitate the restoration of peace in central america.    (oppes) what paths can be taken now to advance the negotiations?    (zamora) negotiations are becoming increasingly necessary.  the guerrilla offensive shows that the fmln is a strong military force, but also that a revolutionary attitude does not exist among the masses.  it also shows that the government army, after 10 years of u.s. training, is an army whose military stance is defensive, not offensive (which is the key to u.s. military strategy.)  while this all shows that there can only be a negotiated solution to the crisis, it is also true that precisely following the guerrilla offensive (and this is the paradox) the army stiffened its stance against negotiations.  i believe that sooner or later common sense will prevail and it will sit down at the negotiating table.  at the end of november the u.s. secretary of state's assistant for latin america spoke officially for the first time about the need for negotiations to resolve the crisis in el salvador: this is an important sign of a changing situation.", "extracts": {"PerpInd": [[["five soldiers", 81]]], "PerpOrg": [[["army", 475]]], "Target": [], "Victim": [], "Weapon": []}}

(words indistinct), as cristiani said, that it was col benavides, but it was not col benavides who issued the order.  so, the question is: who gave the order to kill the jesuits and their two maids.  in our view, col benavides was implicated solely as a means of propaganda aimed at the u.s. congress.  it is clear that col benavides did not give the order.  he probably did not even know about the action.  this is consistent with what we know about his background.  first, he is not known to have carried out acts of repression or corruption.  our report indicates that benavides has    maintained a position in favor of institutions and open to discussions. he was described as an active, studious and not repressive cadet, one of the few exceptions in la tandona (reference to the 1977 graduating class of the captain general gerardo barrios military academy).  in other words, for the la tandona, a gang of assassins, he is a perfect scapegoat.    the massacre of the jesuits was not a personal decision.  it was part of the armed forces' counteroffensive actions during the november battles.  it was a cold-blooded, premeditated plan executed to decapitate the people's movement and the democratic opposition.  let us remember the threats against father ellacuria over the national radio network prior to the assassination.  let us remember that between the night of 15 november and early morning of 16 november, several offices of labor unions and houses of opposition members were attacked.  let us remember that after the masssacre of the jesuits, the officers shouted over loudspeakers that they had killed ellacuria and that they were going to continue killing communists.  the bishop of san salvador was a witness to this.    in our view, the assassins of the jesuits were those who appeared on the radio and television network making known the results of the so-called honor commission.  col benavides will probably be freed in a short time and be appointed to some post abroad, or he might experience the same fate as that of captain eduardo alfonso avila, who went in and out of jail each time that military aid for el salvador was discussed in the u.s. congress.    however, in any case and as has always occurred, it will be the lieutenants, the noncommissioned officers, and the soldiers who carried out an order who will pay the consequences.  we have already seen this happen in the cases of the nuns when (words indistinct) a few soldiers, the massacre of san francisco, and the assassination of the u.s. advisers and rodolfo viera.

(valdes, interrupting) yes, but this takes time.    (azcona) yes.  at this stage i believe there is sufficient proof that the democratic system is the best means of attaining higher levels of development.  there is no doubt in anyone's mind about that, but the fact that we have this system is not enough.  each one of us, each sector, must do his part to make it work.    when i mention sectors, i am referring to private enterprise, which must be generous, exhibit confidence in the country, and show much initiative; to organized labor groups, which must fight for their rights without fomenting strikes and other disorders, which are sometimes brought about illegally instead of following the normal legal procedures; to professional associations, which also have an enormous responsibility, because their members must comply with their duties; and the same goes for government employees and others.    in other words, this will not be accomplished by this or the next government alone.  our governments are transitory and their power is relative.  i have said this many times.  there is no point in lashing out at the president, because power in honduras is relative and conditional. what is essential is to contribute positively toward honduras' development.  this should be a responsibility not only of public employees, businessmen, workers, and organized peasants, but all hondurans should contribute.  that is what counts.    (valdes) mr president, when will this meeting be held and what immediate measures will you propose?    (azcona) the appropriate authorities are doing everything possible to investigate the latest crime, which was not an everyday occurrence like a robbery or something of that nature.  this crime was carefully planned.  it was a terrorist act perpetrated by professionals.    (valdes) mr president, some people have been saying that the death penalty might be a way to cope with the situation.  what do you think about this?    (azcona) i recently read something about the death penalty in a mexican magazine.  the death penalty is opposed by a majority of the people and has been abolished in honduras.  i do not think this is the solution here because the death penalty has not solved the crime problem anywhere else in the world.  for instance, this penalty exists in many u.s. states, but this has not deterred criminals from committing terrible crimes.  people have lost control.  when criminals have no respect for their fellow man, not even the death penalty can stop them.  however, there are crimes, such as drug trafficking, for which no bail should be permitted.  i think a bill that has been proposed by the supreme court of justice should be passed by the congress.  of course, it will be approved by the president so those found guilty of this crime cannot be bailed out.  it is not right for the authorities to arrest a drug trafficker only to see him released on bail by a judge who has no other choice than to abide by the law.    (valdes) mr president, the far rightist group aaa (anticommunist action alliance), through a local radio station, warned that they will take revenge on major communist leaders, such as jorge arturo reina, ramon custodio, and others.  what do you have to say about this?    (azcona) i am adamantly opposed to this type of revenge because it would only lead to escalated confrontations between groups.  i condemn this attitude in view of the regrettable murder of general gustavo alvarez martinez.  as far as the death penalty goes, it will not be a solution to the crime problem.    (valdes) mr president, civic committees have to be organized in the country.    (azcona) i agree, but these committees should be controlled by the authorities.  a civic committee to protect communities is one thing, but it is quite another thing to sue these committees to perform duties that are already the responsibility of state agencies, such as the armed forces.

(reporter) after the attack, instead of seeking a detente, the army, on the contrary, continued its provocations.  for instance, several plainclothes members of the 1st infantry brigade (words indistinct) fenastras and the popular movement took them prisoner.  more than 30 of them were detained.  we learned this afternoon that the police released a communique saying they would station antiriot policemen at the national cemetery.  we also heard col mauricio vargas saying that, if the dialogue door is closed, it has to be kicked open.  what do you think of the situation after the cowardly attack on fenastras?    we think all these activities of the death squads, the 1st infantry brigade, the police, and the national guard are only the open expression of the armed forces' position, which is to plan a full-scale confrontation with the popular movement.  we think this indicates (words indistinct) behind the backs of the majority of armed forces members.  it is a minority who have decided on these provocations against the popular movement.  this movement, however, is sufficiently strong to disarm these provocateurs, present them to the press, and hand them over to show that the people express their tremendous power whenever they want.    (reporter) with la tandona (reference to 1966 graduates of the captain gerardo barrios military academy) in power, and with the situation the arena (national republican alliance) era has ushered in, is there no possible solution through dialogue?  what other alternative do you have?    (sancho) i believe that it is quite clear that president cristiani and the high command are practically doing away with political opportunities, as our earlier communique issued after the fenastras attack indicates. the end result is that since there is no political framework within which to establish a political game with certain political rules for the opposition and state forces, our only other alternative is to immediately take up our weapons, because there is no other way of guaranteeing the survival of the popular movement and the nation.  the people's legitimate right to defense is becoming increasingly legitimate, and it is gaining greater national and international recognition.    (reporter) the popular movement is once again facing a decisive moment in the country's history, and the workers are giving their share of blood in this struggle.  what message would you send to the popular movement, especially to the comrade workers at fenastras?    (sancho) on this occasion, i wish to send a special message to fenastras.  i must tell them to continue to be inspired by the purest concepts of the popular struggle, to keep their inspiration, to be creative and cool, and that when people begin to create their own history, they are truly invincible.    i believe that fenastras has the people's full support and that it will gradually gain even more support.  fenastras must continue--as its leaders say--on the warpath.  in reality, the cost in lives of leaders such as febe elizabeth and all the others who were killed, as well as those killed in the past, is quite high.  the cost is political.  it has taken lives but this, in reality, strengthens the organization.  the people's response has been one of anger and discontent, and this discontent will eventually turn into a clamor for armed struggle by sectors that really (words indistinct) and to achieve our people's freedom.

{"docid": "DEV-MUC3-0171", "doctext": "political life in colombia is still linked with violence.....    (cepeda) colombia is experiencing an extremely severe political and institutional crisis, caused by the incompatibility between the fast developing productive forces and the existing political setup.  for example, last year colombia's economic growth was 4.5 percent.  however, political life continues to be dominated by the two old parties -- the liberals and the conservatives, who maintain a merely formal democracy.  we should not forget colombia's strategic position:  it forms a bridge between central and south america.  all events in colombia affect the neighboring countries.      precisely because of this, the so-called \"santa fe-2\" document, drawn up by extreme right-wing u.s. politicians, contains a plan to apply pressure in colombia and, more specifically, to expand the so-called low-intensity conflict, one of whose manifestations is the so-called \"dirty war\" in the country.    accordingly, the violence in colombia is caused by both internal factors -- the crisis of the institutions -- and external ones, namely the policies of the most reactionary circles in the united states.    (sertov) can one expect the peace settlement to be fulfilled under these conditions?    (cepeda) this is the aim of the communist party of colombia (pcc).  at our recent 15th congress, we made a detailed analysis of the situation and concluded that the conflict in colombia must be settled by political means. the pcc raised the question of removing the siege situation that, with a few interruptions, has been maintained for several decades, and of disbanding the paramilitary groups (according to the minister of internal affairs, about 140 such groups are operating).  these groups owe their very existence to the support given by military circles and the clan chiefs to the trade in narcotics.  (i will add in parentheses that this is the reason for the use of the term \"narcomilitarism\" in colombia.) one of the pcc's demands is that the army should be purged of fascist elements and that a civilian should be put in charge of the ministry of defense.  the party also raised the question of making a start on the necessary democratic reforms, but the government pays no heed to our demands.    the government recently reached an agreement with \"m-19,\" one of the partisan groupings in the country, but did not accept any commitments in practice.  accordingly, there are some doubts over how the lives of the partisan leaders will be subsequently guaranteed.  the largest partisan group -- the revolutionary armed forces of colombia -- is demanding that the government take serious steps to limit the paramilitary groups, in order to conclude a truce.    (sertov) clearly, it will not be easy to achieve peace in colombia.    (cepeda) at the moment, peace supporters in colombia are forming  a broad front, which in practice has an antifascist orientation.  peace depends on how far this front will succeed in expanding, how the contradictions within the government itself regarding the paramilitary groups will deepen, and on whether we will succeed in isolating them.  we are optimists, but also have a great need of international solidarity.    (sertov) how do you assess the political prospects for the united left in your country?    (cepeda) the left forces in colombia are united in the patriotic union that was created 4 years ago.  its aim is to achieve national reconciliation in our country.  however, the union immediately became a target of the organizers of the \"dirty war.\" hundreds of its leaders were beaten up, many of whom were pcc members.  so far, over 1,000 people have died, including jaime pardo leal, leader of the patriotic union, deputy chairman jose anteguera, and others.  threats continue to be made against the union and against the pcc.  all members of the pcc leadership have received death threats.  the same also applies to bernardo jaramillo, the present leader of the union, gilberto vieira, secretary general of the pcc central committee, and others.    on 27 february comrade forero (name as transliterated), pcc secretary for organizational matters, was killed.  his wife and comrades sotelo and sotomayor also died in the atrocity.  next day, we had a meeting with virgilio barco, president of colombia.  he promises to take speedy measures against the paramilitary groups.  however, only 4 days later, anteguera, the former leader of the union of communist youth, was killed at bogota airport.  senator ernesto pisano, one of the liberal party candidates for the presidency, was seriously injured at the same time.  many members of the military were present at the airport on that day, as well as the police chief of the capital, yet only one of the murderers was killed, while the rest escaped.  this is why we told president barco that we had serious doubts about the army's role in this assassination.      next year, presidential elections and elections of the legislative bodies are due to take place in colombia.  the pcc and the patriotic union want to take part in them, but we have warned the leaders of the republic that unless the \"dirty war\" is ended, we will expose the situation in colombia to the world and regard the election results as illegal.  despite everything, we consider that the patriotic union has a promising future, because its aims are supported by the colombian people.", "extracts": {"PerpInd": [[["paramilitary groups", 1634]]], "PerpOrg": [], "Target": [], "Victim": [[["anteguera", 3751]], [["comrade forero", 4080]], [["comrades sotelo", 4189]], [["comrades sotelo and sotomayor", 4189], ["sotomayor", 4209]], [["ernesto pisano", 4518]]], "Weapon": []}}

{"docid": "DEV-MUC3-0185", "doctext": "recently comrade manuel cepeda, member of the colombian communist party central committee politburo, visited czechoslovakia; we asked him for an interview.    (posledni) in the course of a few days at the beginning of march, three leading officials of the colombian communist party and the leftist coalition, the patriotic union (up), comrades forero, sotelo, and antequera, were murdered in colombia.  why?      (cepeda) in colombia the dirty war stemming from the american tactics of so-called low-intensity conflict is intensifying.  the internal political crisis is deepened by an alliance between the powerful drug smuggling clans and the military leadership which is conducting the dirty war.  in the santa fe ii document, formulating future united states policy in latin america, it is even said that unless the united states intervenes in the 1990's colombia will become another el salvador and on a much larger scale.  the so-called extermination operation, also known as the condor plan, is directed against the communist party and up, against the unions, but also against priests who preach liberation theology, and recently this has intensified.  in colombia some elements of fascism openly manifest themselves.  this is manifested in huge and unpunished massacres and in the powerlessness of president barco and his civilian ministers who are not managing to keep the military leadership in check, although the president is the supreme commander of the armed forces.    (posledni) sometimes partisans are also accused of terror.      (cepeda) that is one of the traits of american policy -- to term any kind of revolutionary struggle, of struggle for democracy, and the people's movement as terrorism.  therefore, it also labels the sandinistas in nicaragua as terrorists and the contra rebels as freedom fighters.  by this i do not want to say that the partisans do not make mistakes, we also criticize them.  for example, we condemned the destruction of oil piplines by the colombian partisan organization the national liberation army (eln). we do not agree with kidnapping civilians in exchange for ransom.  we announced that, as long as it is impossible to end the conflict, it is necessary to humanize it and to respect human lives.  these are the tactics of soldiers -- to label the partisans as terrorists and then massacre the civilian population as suspects who are collaborating with terrorism.    (posledni) partisans from the revolutionary armed forces of colombia (farc) offered the government a dialogue about a truce.  how do they want to conduct this?    (cepeda) the farc, which is the strongest element of the colombian partisan movement and a member of its coordinating committee, unilaterally adopted a cease-fire and proposed the creation of a commission for this dialogue.  in it are two former presidents, the liberal lopez michelsen and the conservative pastrana, the chairman of the association of industrialists echeverri correa, and bogota's cardinal rebollo.  the farc wants the government to disband the paramilitary groups.  the former interior minister, gaviria, said that there are 140 of them.  this means that the government knows them.  the farc is demanding the purge of people from the army command involved in the dirty war, that the defense minister be a civilian, that the state of emergency be revoked, and that the road to real democracy be opened.    (posledni) but the government has begun negotiating with partisans from m-19.    (cepeda) the el tiempo newspaper reported that the government promised them representation in parliament by their inclusion as candidates of the liberal party.  this is to involve four seats as long as m-19 lays down its arms and disbands.  the other partisans bitterly criticized this as a blow against the unity of the movement which will be abused for propaganda purposes.  at the same time, m-19 represents only 5 percent of the movement.  it is the intention of the government to divide the partisans.    (posledni) the colombian communist party congress took place in december.  how did it react to the situation?    (cepeda) the party called for peace and outlined the struggle for a pluralist government of transition towards peace and democracy.  at the end of february there was a central committee session which discussed the dirty war.  it stated that, in spite of the terror, there had not been what had happened in similar situations in other latin american countries, namely, mass emigration.  to ensure that this does not happen in the future, the central committee discussed new measures, including the transition of part of the party to the underground.  we will not all transfer, because now we must struggle for open contact with the masses, regardless of the huge risk which is linked to this.    (posledni) where is the party seeking allies?      (cepeda) comrade antequera, as deputy chairman of the up, had established a number of contacts.  however, he was murdered, and senator samper pisano, a politician from the ruling liberal party, was seriously injured during the assassination at bogota airport on 3 march.  the assassination attempt against the 32-year-old prospective politician occurred the day after he announced his candidacy for the presidency.  he announced his support for democratic coexistence, for an end to the dirty war which, as he said, is not in the interest of the colombian people.  therefore, he was not a chance victim.  it is also significant that the closed circuit television covering the airport, which is in the hands of the army, was switched off.  thus, they wanted to prevent the murderers being filmed.  one of them died, they let the other three escape.  at the same time, bogota's chief of police was at the airport along with another 10 colonels and a number of policemen and personal bodyguards.    (posledni) how did the other parties react to the assassination?    (cepeda) a joint document was signed by the colombian communist  party, the up, and the liberal party, on whose behalf the former president turbay ayala signed.  it demands that the government disband the paramilitary squads.  it shows that opinions are beginning to differ, even in the ruling liberal party.  the conservatives are also emphatically criticizing the bloodbath and the passivity of the government, pointing out that their last president, betancur, conducted a dialogue with the partisans.  this is all happening before the elections which will take place next year.    (posledni) the colombian communist party leadership met with the president after the murder of comrade forero.  what was that about?    (cepeda) in the conversation, we pointed to the fact that the defense minister, general guerrero paz, travels around colombia accompanied by the leader of the ultra-right wing, retired general landazabal reyes, who is leader of the paramilitary groups.  we asked why these two are together. the president did not answer us.  at the meeting we also said that, unless the dirty war stops, the colombian communist party for the first time in history will not take part in the elections.  we will not be able to participate, because we are all being murdered.  unless the government gives us a guarantee of security, we will not sacrifice more lives.

(reporter) do you mean that a military government is at times more effective?    (larco cox) no.  it is much more effective for repression, but i made it clear that subversion in a democracy is unjustified and that democratic governments do not promote human rights violations.  if there are any human rights violations in a democracy, they stem from excesses by the repressive forces.

(larco cox) it is simple.  in a dictatorship, repression is widespread and almost always arbitrary, and there is no one to defend human rights.

(reporter) there has also been a growth in the crime rate and the costly process of fighting the shining path guerrillas in the mountains and in urban terrorist actions.  this could easily lead to the conclusion that peruvian democracy does not have good prospects, right?    (larco cox) quito to the contrary.  democracy will be preserved even if the normal handing over of power to the new administration becomes the only objective of the recently installed cabinet.  this, however, will become the sole objective only in an estreme situation.  there are obviously other objectives, but i want to stress the significance that we attach to the handing over of power to the winner of clean elections, with guarantees for all opposition parties.  this is how the democratic process will be preserved and this is how this government will attain one of its main targets.", "extracts": {"PerpInd": [], "PerpOrg": [], "Target": [], "Victim": [], "Weapon": []}}

{"docid": "DEV-MUC3-0244", "doctext": "when we asked the foreign ministry why the honduran government has not protested the salvadoran armed forces attacks on honduran army soldiers and a helicopter in los llanitos (intibuca), the answer was very simple, but it shows the importance that is given to national sovereignty and integrity: the armed forces have not informed us of anything at all -- they said -- and what the media says is not accurate.    the newspapers tiempo and la prensa published reports of the incident with photographs that confirmed the aggression, the bombing and shelling of villages in our territory, and provided accounts by eyewitnesses and municipal authorities, but which, according to the foreign ministry, lack credibility or importance.    later foreign newsmen went to these places and confirmed what tiempo and la prensa had reported.  they also obtained other details on the incidents. while the honduran and salvadoran armed forces denied the incident, despite the evidence, the truth is there for the gentlemen of the foreign ministry to see.    according to statements by the villagers who were the victims of the salvadoran aggression, the honduran military threatened them and ordered them to be silent or to lie about what had happened.  it was necessary for the santa lucia mayor to intervene before they could tell newsmen what had happened.  a reporter for la prensa was sidetracked by a commander, no doubt to keep him from doing his job as a journalist.    the honduran army's weapons served to keep the aggression quiet instead of repelling it, to threaten honduran border villagers instead of protecting them, while the army turned its back on the enemy armed forces -- which have trampled on our territory and humiliated us -- instead of fighting them.  in short, the weapons that we hondurans and the armed forces have obtained with so much sacrifice, even at the expense of going without food and medicine, are used against honduras and its people.      this situation should cause us to give much thought to the existence of the honduran armed forces.  we anticipated this when the regional military training and security center (crems) was created exclusively to train 10,000 salvadoran troops -- the same army that invaded us in 1969 and that is attacking us again.    we wonder if we are not acquiring a mercenary mentality in honduras, whereby the state's weapons go to the highest bidder rather than being used in the national interest.  for the past 7 years they have been used for economic -- though ideologically disguised -- benefits.    no national military force can function like this anywhere in the world. in any event, the ideology of any army should be nationalistic, even in the case of powers and superpowers that invent and use internationalist ideologies for their hegemonic struggles.    here in honduras the case of the armed forces is just the opposite.  to the military institute's way of thinking, those who are demanding the defense of sovereignty and territorial integrity are subversives who are allied with subversives from other countries.  an aggression against honduras by a foreign army is legitimized by the people attacked and those who inform and protest are enemies of the fatherland.    this was stated in an editorial of the honduran armed forces' \"military projections\" program.  the editorial said that the report was issued \"without prior investigation\" and was based solely \"on information provided by these groups to confuse national and international public opinion.\"    \"the irresponsibility of some print and broadcast media directors has reached the point that they are promoting these clearly marxist - leninist subversives, financed by cuba and nicaragua, and those who do not hide their open sympathy with pseudo-professional positions.  they attempt to conceal this by claiming that radio stations or newspapers have unrestricted freedom of expression.\"    a similar explanation was presented by the salvadoran embassy in tegucigalpa in a press communique distributed to the media, which published and disseminated it -- although it appears incredible -- through the official presidential house bulletins.  we might add that the honduran army has echoed such reports, as an accomplice to a propaganda ploy to cover up an aggression against our country.    we ask, therefore:  \"what is left of our national institutions?  what is honduras?  who are hondurans?\"", "extracts": {"PerpInd": [], "PerpOrg": [[["honduran military", 1140]]], "Target": [], "Victim": [], "Weapon": []}}

(changes thought).  instead, i should say that they went to have some fun at the dilido discoteque. our military police patrols were in the area and saw the attack.  we captured two suspects.  our men were about 100 meters away when the attack occurred, and, unfortunately, the two suspects are u.s.  citizens.  in other words, people were in the area and no one knew what they were doing.  this is an official report; this is what took place in la ceiba.  the two suspects were arrested, and they must know something about the seven who were wounded, who are at the (word indistinct) hospital.  what you reported over the radio is correct.  there is no need to be alarmed.  it was a homemade bomb, and the damage was caused by the shrapnel, cement, and stones that were thrown into the air by the explosion.      however, i would like to deny a report by the milkman from (word indistinct), who said that the city has been shut down and is being held hostage.  that is not true.  when the incident occurred, (words indistinct) the patrols were already on the streets and reported the incident.  fusep (the public security force) was instructed to conduct investigations, and therefore vehicles entering or leaving la ceiba were stopped and searched. that is all; standstill merely because three or four people have been wounded, or because two or three are critically wounded.    the city must function normally.  the armed forces are interested in the continuation of production.  so the man from (word indistinct) who called and said that he was losing 100,000 lempiras (as a result of the vehicle searches) this morning was telling a lie.  we gave specific instructions that the inspection of vehicles should be carried until 0500, and that the vehicles should not be detained.    (reporter) colonel, it was the chamber of commerce president who provided the report and said that the delivery of milk had been stopped.    (sanchez) with all due respect for him -- whom i do not know personally -- i must say that it is not true that we are stopping vehicles (as heard). we stopped a very small white van with some laborers in it to search the van.  i was there on the highway.  there was no milk on that bus; there were people on that bus, and i myself allowed them to continue.  i am sorry that the chamber of commerce has been misinformed.  we are not paralyzing activities, nor are we holding the city hostage.  as i said, we are trying to conduct an investigation and we have arrested two people. we are not sure if they were the ones who perpetrated the attack; we are not sure of anything.  we are merely conducting investigations and taking preventive measures.    (reporter) colonel, are the two men you have in custody the same u.s. citizens you mentioned at the beginning of this report?    (sanchez) yes.  the lieutenant in charge of the patrol (words indistinct) the pants, clothes, and the color of what they were wearing indicated that they were civilians.  lieutenant salgado of the 4th battalion was 50 meters away when the explosion occurred.  two persons were captured.  however, they have denied that either of them was involved.  that remains to be seen.  we have been waiting for about 30 minutes for the armed forces investigative personnel to arrive to learn the identities of the two men who are being held.  the investigation will be completely professional.  we (words indistinct) two or three persons were injured.  we are not paralyzing production; i want to made this clear.    (reporter) yes, of course.  colonel, given the situation, do you believe that the situation in the armed forces is completely normal?    (sanchez) of course it is completely normal.  we are not restricting anyone's freedom.  when it gets dark, we will proceed to ask for identification papers; we will stop and check vehicles, which is normal in this type of situation.  however, at no time will we paralyze production or normal daily activities.  we are trying to find the culprits responsible for this attack.  regardless of whether it was an attack against u.s.  citizens, it was certainly an attack against peace and order.  we therefore have to investigate it, regardless of whether or not it involved u.s.  citizens.  in this case, and in view of this situation, i personally issued orders and followed the investigation until 0500, when i suspended all operations.  i personally ordered these measures.  i am amazed that the cattlemen do not transport milk before 0500.    (reporter) one last question on this matter:  is the situation in la ceiba related to the latest violent incidents in san pedro sula?    (sanchez) i believe so.  a series of criminal actions has been launched against social peace in honduras.  this station's listeners and listeners of all other honduran radio stations know the high - caliber of the armed forces personnel, beginning with the top commanders and continuing with officers down the chain of command.  we are sensitive to social isses and are not motivated by vested interests of any kind.  i believe that these acts of bloodshed, which are (words indistinct), are part of a series of fully planned, coldly calulated actions.    i do not want to sound like a comic strip character, but i believe that these actions are connected and overlap.  i have the impression that (words indistinct).  we are witnessing the emergence of the so-called white hands and black hands (death squads), which concern us very much.  we are talking about hondurans killing hondurans.      (reporter) thank you very much for your kindness to this station.  we will be contacting you during the next few hours to learn the results of the investigations into this homemade bomb attack in la ceiba.    (sanchez) we are completely at your service.  we are willing to offer you information as it comes in.  we are a completely open, not closed, organization.  we will give you truthful, factual information for the benefit of all hondurans.

{"docid": "DEV-MUC3-0313", "doctext": "good evening ladies and gentlemen.  today we will discuss the foreign debt problem.  this subject could perhaps seem a bit out place at a time when more troublesome matters affect all argentine families, such as high public utility rates, prices, controls, difficulties, etc.  however, we must attend to the foreign debt problem because most our difficulties come from it.    of what does this problem consist?  we currently owe $64 billion.  this represents a burden of $6 billion yearly in interest payments.  since argentina is currently exporting $9 billion annually, and if we paid $6 billion in interest, we would only have $3 billion left annually to attend to all our national needs, that is, the needs of industry, commerce, etc.    obviously this is not enough money, and we cannot pay $6 billion in interest each year with $9 billion worth of annual exports.    this is not new.  this is a heavy inheritance, which originated not in the recent past but more than 10 years ago.  when martinez de hoz became economy minister (march 1976), the foreign debt amounted to $9 billion. when he concluded his term, the debt amounted to $29 billion.  the military governments that came after him dragged the debt along and increased it to $44 billion which they passed to president alfonsin. alfonsin's administration increased the debt by an additional $20 billion. so today our debt amounts to $64 billion.    this is not all.  we ceased honoring our commitments abroad.  we have not even paid interest since april last year.  we have only made token payments.  this refutes the ideas of those who say: let us stop paying our debt and use the resources to make the country grow.  we are not paying anything.    for more than a year we have not been paying anything, and not only has the economy not grown, but it shrank.    argentina has an extremely low credit rating.  countries are internationally classified by their credit, and we are in one of the lowest categories.  our commercial credit is also being curtailed.  commercial credits are the ones that allow us to import, export, and meet our daily needs.    when the new administration assumed power on 8 april 1989, the central bank's foreign reserves were exhausted.  this situation can turn into a crisis at any moment.  we cannot continue like this.    the coming of this new government, which has brought about positive expectations and hope, and which is undertaking remarkable changes -- mainly changes of mentality -- has stopped the crisis from exploding.  but we cannot rest on our achievements.  we must face this problem immediately.    our starting point in certainly very uncomfortable.  our country has no prestige abroad; we have lost our credibility.  no one even wants to hear about argentina, or at least about its debt.  in the past few years we have not honored any of our commietments.  every time we signed a letter of intent with the imf, we knew that we could not comply with it.  there have been several letters of intent we did not comply with.    what policy will we follow in the future?  the president defined it in his message to congress on 8 july.  he said we have a heavy burden, a debt that was unwisely contracted, but it is a commitment of honor.  he used words that were common in argentina in the past.      it was once said: we will comply with our commitments, even at the cost of hunger and thirst for the argentine people.  the president has made his own commitment on this subject.  we will pay according to the capability of the nation, and the only thing we require is a bit of time and, of course, flexibility on the part of our creditors.    if we did not honor our commitments, if we had said we are not going to pay, the situation in our country would be dramatically worse.  we would be isolated.  we would not be able to obtain credits, we would not be able to obtain foreign capital investments.  in a word, we would not be able to integrate the rest of the world, which is quickly expanding and progressing.  we would be much more backward than we are today.  therefore there is really no question of paying or not paying.  the honor of the country is at stake.    what is the role of the foreign debt in our economic recovery?  you know that we have everything necessary.  we have natural resources, food, energy, fishing, mining, etc.  we have human resources.  you know that when argentines work abroad they are efficient and they are recognized as such. we have no internal religious, racial, or indian problems, not even problems with our neighbors.    what are we missing?  why are we where we are, and why can't we survive? we need two things: first, we need an appropriate economic order.  we live in a deep economic and social disorder.  second, we need capital.  capital is absolutely necessary.    i said that i was going to discuss the savings in argentina that can be tapped.  for years, argentina's savings have been constantly punished by government actions, such as abusive taxes, mandatory savings, and, above all, the great erosion caused by inflation that destroys the currency.  just remember how many times we have changed our currency.  to protect themselves from these losses, what did savers do?  they either took their money abroad or hid it under their mattresses.  we will focus today on the money under the mattresses, although what i will say now will also be relevant for those who have their savings abroad.  according to calculations, there are small, medium, and large savings adding up to nearly $5 billion in the country.  a person was assaulted in cordoba the other day and $250,000 was found in his mattress.  money under the mattress is at risk, does not accrue interest, does not work for the country, and does not give any benefit to the owners nor the country.    some of our hope lies in these savings inside and outside of the country, because they represent a reserve that we have on hand.  we are not bankrupt.  we have those reserves, although they are not working.  the secret is to use them for the country's benefit.  argentina's problems can be resolved if these savings are used.  now, to tap into these savings, the government has made a decision, and the central bank has already translated it into a resolution.  into banks here in the country in dollars, yen, deutsche marks, or any other currency.  they will be able to make withdrawals whenever they want in the same currency in which their savings were deposited.  nobody will be allowed to touch them.  this will be reinforced by a law granting savers the maximum guarantee that no public power can intervene in those savings; that is, there will be a financial system into which those savings, in any currency, can be placed for the benefit of the country and, of course, the depositor.  anybody who has $10,000 under his mattress can take it out, go to the bank, and, under the guarantee of the bank -- not the central bank or the nation, which have been discredited -- the money will be at his disposal at any time.  the bank will lend the money for export operations and for moving the country's wealth. new blood will thus have been injected into the argentine financial system.    i point out that the law will give maximum guarantees. no public power will have the right to seize the savings, nor freeze them, nor postpone their withdrawal.  these are the maximum guarantees that can be given; more is impossible.  each argentine must now think about what this means.  it has a crucial importance, because it injects blood into the social body; it moves the country.  moreover, from the moral standpoint, if we do not do this, how can we go abroad and ask foreigners to invest in argentina -- to bring their money to argentina -- if at the same time i do not invest here because i do not have confidence in my country? this is an immoral position.    if we make the initial effort and deposit $2, 3 or 4 billion in the country, our negotiations abroad take a new twist, because we can say that the argentines have made the first effort.  all this naturally depends on confidence, and confidence in turn depends on taking this first step.  this is a reciprocal effect.  to create confidence, measures such as those adopted by the government and the central bank have to be adopted.  these measures create confidence, and with confidence the country will quickly recover.  we have many other things to say about this, but within the limitation of time, we can stop here.", "extracts": {"PerpInd": [], "PerpOrg": [], "Target": [], "Victim": [], "Weapon": []}}

(passage omitted)    this is the last message i will deliver to congress as president before i turn the presidency over to a citizen elected by the people.    i cannot fail to expand on the achievements made this year, which, honestly speaking are much fewer than in previous years. i am delivering a summary of these achievements in writing, as establish by the constitution, for the use of the legislators. it is a summary of material achievements.    it is now more important to me to say that the main objective of the government in the next 12 months will be to reaffirm the system of democratic freedom, which is the most important system peru has. with this freedom, even the most extreme positions can exist. the reactionary positions of the ultraright and radical ideologies can also live in freedom. violence has less chance of developing in freedom.  the nation has more legitimate means to eradicate violence under freedom.    like any other citizen, i also believe that sometimes disagreements, political parties, laws, and skillful legal procedures can obstruct many things and stop decisions. but this is the price for a civilized lifestyle. democracy does not have the forthrightness of a dictatorship. democracy is slower, but demands more firmness, more conviction, more patience. democracy demands the gradual education of the people; this takes a long time. i am saying this because the country has been suffering a dramatic economic crisis since september 1988, and it has been necessary to make harsh changes at a time when violence has seemed to increase.    we heard some people who had lost their cool demanding an interruption of our democracy. they called for a shorter government term. they also said that the country could defeat the terrorist violence and the economic crisis by restricting freedom and establishing an authoritarian regime.    i believe that those were immature voices, deceitful temptations. many of those voices unfortunately came from people who have more wealth. by doing this they have shown that they are not yet ready to coexist democratically and to accept that social and economic tensions, even at the worse times, should be handled with serenity and patience. a dictatorship that violates legal procedures will only help to increase violence and legitimate insurgency, and would stimulate the creation of new subversive groups. a dictatorship cannot solve the economic crisis. it would only have limited power and would impose a traumatic experience that would lead nowhere.    i am referring to this issue because the next 12 months will be a crucial period. i call on the peruvian people to look at the future of our democracy by realizing that in a democracy the problems are solved with more democracy, with more freedom, and with more participation. to have democracy, one must have a great deal of patience.    this is my last message to congress. i am committed to more freedom and more freedom of expression, which sometimes we doubt because of excesses. but freedom of expression will always be positive, because without freedom of expression abuse will prevail.

(koberg) mr president, an analyst who met with us a short time ago gave his opinion on the possibility of a dialogue and its results.  he was not very optimistic and he said that there were several points that could become obstacles to the dialogue.  one of them was the economic measures.  he said that the fmln could not hold negotiations with the government as long as the government maintained the economic measures it was implementing.  we have learned from the fmln communiques, which always talk about the need to keep implementing the agrarian reform process and other series of points concerning the economic measures.  i would like to ask you, within this framework, what can the government negotiate or what does the government understand by negotiation?  could there be possible negotiation on the economic policy?    (cristiani) i believe the word negotiation here in our country no longer has that generic meaning given by the dictionary.  this word has been manipulated by leftist forces in the sense that to negotiate is to accept what the fmln wants.  according to the left, that is what negotiating means.  i believe the word negotiation has a generic meaning.  a negotiation is to try to find joint agreements to solve a problem and that is what we have been proposing.  we have sought agreements on the largest number of points possible.  logically, not all points will be accepted by the other side and we believe the fmln is making a mistake when it thinks it will negotiate its economic, political, or social platform with the government. the fmln must understand that they have to negotiate their plans for the country with the people.  that is done by political campaigns and by showing their proposals to the public.  if the people are convinced that their proposals are best, they will get the votes and they will have the right to implement their programs and their political, economic, and social programs.    in this case, unfortunately they did not participate; it was our party platform that was chosen by the people.  this gives the government the right to implement what the majority of the people ask of them.    we do not think the fmln should oppose this offering.  the fmln refuses to talk with the government and keeps looking for excuses and setting conditions, such as demanding that the government declare itself temporary before any talks are considered.  they know they are asking the impossible. their true purpose is to refuse to talk seriously, which the salvadoran people wants them to do.  lorena, i do not think we should confuse the various factors involved.  holding a dialogue is not easy, as pointed out by this analyst, whose name i do not know.  the situation is not easy to resolve.  this process could well last many months or even years.  it is necessry to start now with a dialogue in which both sides begin to discuss, not what they cannot agree on, but what we can agree on.  we should begin by trying to eliminate the violence that prevails in the country.  if they find they cannot agree on some of the government proposals, the government should also consider an alternative stance.  the fmln keeps saying that there are no proper conditions for talking.

rather, he represents hunger.    in its 15th congress the pcch made a call to defeat the minister who has made millions of people poor, the minister who has now become a demagogue and is promising the moon and an unrealistic world for the people;

(isayev) yes, while working in latin america as a correspondent for ussr state television and radio i was able to visit medellin once. there was a seminar there on the problems of central america. outwardly it is a very attractive town, very green, situated on a plain, and it is called eternally blossoming.  after several hours in medellin bursts of submachinegun fire rang out suddenly in the streets and i understood then that i was in the center of the cocaine mafia. two clans of bandits were exchanging fire and passers-by literally had to run away from the scene of events as fast as they could.    local colleagues showed me a huge district consisting of luxurious villas where the godfathers of the colombia drug mafia live.  it is difficult to even approach these houses: they are surrounded by barbed wire and there are video cameras and watch towers.  if you decide to go fairly close the guards will open fire withour warning.  i was also able to see a nineteenth-century castle, a rare and extremely beautiful building, a genuine architectural monument.  this castle belongs to one of the heads of the mafia, carlos lehder.    (vedenyapin) yes, yuriy nikolaevich, but how was the medellin cartel formed?  some information on its history, if you could.    (isayev) by rights the founder of the cartel is considered to be carlos enrique lehder, who was able to unite the cocaine mafia of colombia around him at the beginning of the seventies.  a few words about lehder himself: he is a desperate extremist who holds nothing sacred.  he has hundreds of human lives on his conscience.  it is not for nothing that his friends gave him at various times the nick names rum robin hood, the drugs baron, and so on.  carlos lehder is distinguished for his audacity and a restless disposition.  together with him other colombian families have been occupied in this advantageous business, namely the ochoa and escobar families.  at the end of the eighties (as heard) a cocaine war began between these three clans.  later, however, they came to an agreement and the medellin cartel was formed    (vedenyapin) in the press many reports have appeared stating that literally billions of dollars pass through the hands of the cartel. is this true?    (isayev) the cartel's annual income, as the press claims, is $8 billion.  to sketch the scale of cocaine operations i will remind you that in 1984, for example, the cartel bigwigs proposed to the government to clear colombia's entire foreign debt within a week -- and i will remind you that this is $9 billion -- if the government would release mafia members who had been arrested.  not very long ago a west german magazine published a list of the richest people in the world and one of the heads of the medellin cartel -- jorge ochoa -- is by no means last on that list.  i would like to mention another case that characterizes the dimensions of the drug mafia's means. four years ago it came to light that the cartel had taken part in negotiations on buying a whole consignment of surface-to-air missiles, several military helicopters, and other modern weapons.    (vedenyapin) how is this lethal arsenal used?    (isayev) it is completely natural that the cartel could not exist without a complete army of mercenary killers and informants who have penetrated into literally all spheres of the colombian economy, parliament, and the army.  the main target of the mafiosi are progressive politicians, who in one way or another threaten the drugs business.  i will remind you that the same carlos lehder in 1984 organized the assassination of lara bonilla, the colombian minister of justice.  in 1986 guillermo cano, the director of the progressive newspaper el espectador was murdered, and it was basically after this muder that the hunt for lehder began.  in the same year he was arrested and handed over to u.s. justice, which sentenced him to life imprisonment.  it should also be noted that there exists an agreement between the u.s. and colombian governments on the extradition of especially dangerous criminals.

(asturias) i believe this is an interesting question that needs to be clarified. at the end of september, the urng general command made a new proposal aimed at finding a political solution to the internal armed conflict our country is experiencing. the proposal to find a political solution and to establish a dialogue as a first step to create the conditions is very important because it entails an increased effort in the struggle for democracy. we do not think of dialogue and negotiation as a demobilization element but as an extremely active element, as a clarifying element, to find and put in place consensus with democratic solutions. this is why although there has been, in fact, an increase of repression -- which by the way, it was brutally intensified last month -- the proposal to find a political solution and the call all national sectors, without exception, to begin contacts, talks, and dialogue with the unrg despite the fact that the government continues to refuse them and continues maintaining a closed position. it is an important step in the democratic struggle.    (reporter) commander gaspar, insisting in the last part of your response, what are the basis in which this type of talks and dialogue could be initiated?    (asturias) since october 1987, when its first dialogue initiative was established, the general command has said preestablished conditions are not necessary but that the country's fundamental problems should be included in the dialogue and the preparation of the agenda. the main problem the country has and has had in the last few years is the lack of respect toward human rights, the militarization of the guatemalan society, and the generalized oppression experienced. therefore, we believe the main point that needs to be addressed in the agenda is the democratization.    (reporter) speaking of the internal situation from the military point of view, news agency report every day of missing persons, killings, and tortures. are the ones everyone knows as the death squadrons increasing their activities?    (asturias) indeed, there has been an increase in repression. we could say without being mistaken that there is a terrorist escalation headed by state security forces. it is very important to denounce and to be clear on this because the ones that are carrying out this repression and the ones that are taking forward this terror campaign are not paramilitary groups as the people have been led to believe and they are not extreme-right civilian groups. they are army operative groups that act based on information, charges, suspicions, or many times blindly to see what information they can find, in what way they can hit or infiltrate the people's and revolutionary movement.  we are faced with an escalation of the strongest state terrorism.  it cannot be confused with death squadrons or differences within the right wing. the army is the one responsible of the repression.

(garcia) we have a common stance.  no country can pay what it is being asked to pay.  we all know this.  people know it.  the labor unions know it.  therefore, that is our stance.    a few years ago some countries made an effort to pay.  nowaday, everybody knows they cannot pay and they are struggling to change the payment conditions.  this is the basic issue that we all share.    the fact that some countries resort to the brady plan, that others seek other alternatives, or that others choose not to pay a debt that they consider to be unfair -- at leat until conditions change or payments are reduced -- are simply different shades of a common stance.  the important point is that we are gradually verifying that no country is able to pay the debt in contracted, a debt that has grown only because of interests.    i will reiterate some dramatic but realistic figures: 10 years ago latin america owed $190 billion.  it paid $289 billion to december 1988 -- that is 10 years -- and it still owes $430 billion.  in the past 10 years latin america has reduced its per capita consumption dramatically by 2 to 3 percent a year.  in the past 10 years latin america reduced its imports, seeking to spend less dollars.  it increased its exports and devalued its currencies to obtain dollars with which to pay the debt.    in the past 10 years latin america grew only 1 percent per year, and it has used that 1 percent, plus an additional 4-percent of its gnp, to pay the debt.    therefore, under these conditions, 10 years later we find that we owe more, produce less, and it is impossible to pay our debt.  we all know this.  it has cost us 10 years to understand it.  however it is an experience that constitutes the base for our common stance.

(garcia) would there have been a brady plan if we had not met in acapulco or in punta del este?  one of james brady's advisers published an article in the new york times stating that the brady plan was announced in september 1985 to prevent the dissemination of the peruvian attitude of unilaterally reducing its debt payments.    who knows if the acapulco and punta del este meetings have not led the creditors to acknowledge that the debt is not worth its face value and that it must be reduced?    therefore, there has been progress.  who knows if next year we will be speaking of reducing the debt by 50 percent and not just the 20 percent that we now seek?    you see, the fact is that not only are we unable to pay and that we are negotiating to pay less, but the creditors also know that they will not be able to collect their money if they insist on their claims.    therefore, if the united states and the soviet union are heading to ward disarmament, why can't there be a financial disarmament between the rich and poor?  i think that economic trends will follow this line.    (reporter) president, why hasn't panama been definitively expelled from this group, and will the group of eight expand?    (garcia) panama as a country, independent of its past administrations, was a founder member of the group of eight.  no country can be expelled.  this is a term that would offend the citizenry of a country.  we simply ratified the suspension of panama indefinitely until panama is governed by a democratically elected government.  that was our decision.    (reporter) (passage indistinct) the oas?    (garcia) we are preparing a proposal in which we state that the oas is an important forum or mechanism for hemispheric dialogue but which must include the presence of cuba and other countries which are yet not members.    (reporter) will the group of eight expand?    (garcia) i hope so.  this is the last year in which i will attend a meeting of the group of eight, which i helped to create.  however, i hope this group will lead annual and periodical meetings of all latin america presidents.  i have maintained this hope since 1985.  i hope that latin america will annually coordinate some kind of collegial executive branch to make important decisions.  the group of eight is the beginning of this, and i am sure that it will expand in the future.    however, at a continental level, the issues cannot run as fast as for a country, a people, or a political process.  a continent requires much longer terms and we must be patient.  let us go to another subject now.    (reporter) human rights.  two of the main issues in latin american life are democratization and human rights.  president menem has recently pardoned military officers and terrorists who were serving prison sentences.  there is also a conflictive situation in peru regarding some military officers who are being tried for murders committed in jails.  are you willing to pardon those military officers to pacify the situation?  this is my first question.    second, the peruvian image through the international media is very bad because of a lack of information.  in contrast with acapulco and punta del este, which are holiday resorts with multimillion dollar infrastructures, the city of ica represents thousands of latin american cities.  therefore, what is your administration doing to thruthfully report on peruvian reality?  tion doing to thruthfully report on peruvian reality?

(ortega) u.s. congressmen are only concerned about their reelection.  with the due respect that some of them deserve, u.s. congressmen are only worried about their reelection.  i have talked to many of them here and they are cynical.  they tell me: i disagree with that but i have to think about those who elected me.  if those who elected me have a different opinion, then i have to express support for their viewpoints and forget about my own opinion.  let us not mislead ourselves.  you know very well how u.s. congressmen act. therefore, it was easier for them to simply approve funds for the contras as they had done -- because the congress had approved the so-called humanitarian aid for the contras (words indistinct) and let the war continue, and leave the burden on the central american governments, especially on the nicaraguan government and people who are suffering the effects of this war.  therefore, we have been reporting the killings, the assassinations, the crimes, the contras attacks, and the yankee congress has remained silent.    therefore, we see an easy-going attitude in the u.s. congress. obviously, when we announce we are not going to extend the cease-fire the u.s. congress reacts immediately.  they react because they are fully aware that they are meddling in nicaraguan politics.  they will have to resume discussions on the nicaraguan issue, and they do not want to discuss the nicaraguan issue again.  it was easy to set aside the nicaraguan issue and to simply approve funds for the contras so the contras could continue killing nicaraguans while everything else remains calm -- let the peace plan continue as far as it can and as far as president bush allows it to develop.  the u.s. congressmen can then forget about the nicaraguan issue and work on other domestic or international issues in which they are more interested.    however, when nicaragua says: we will not extend the cease-fire, then they raise an outcry.  why do they raise an outcry?  because they know they will have to resume discussions on the nicaraguan issue. moreover, there might be a feverish congressman who will propose giving military aid to the contras.  well, let them discuss military aid.  do they want to discuss military aid, well that is their problem.  we simply believe that the way the yankee congress actions will ease or hinder the electoral process.  the development of elections on 25 february will depend now on the yankee congress and on the yankee president.  it will depend on them.  we have the desire to do it.  however, whether or not the elections are held on 25 february will depend on them.

(gonzalez) in my opinion, two positions on the dialogue and the negotiations process were made evident in san jose.  the government of alfredo cristiani and the armed forces high command view the dialogue as an opportunity for talking, buying time, and building a good image for themselves.  on the other hand, the fmln is working for a real negotiations process.  the fmln has opened a broader debate, a debate that includes discussions with and the participation of political parties, the social forces, the church, all the sectors. we have initiated a national dialogue.  as we see it, the goal is part of a whole, it is not everything.  the entire process of allowing the participation of the social forces is important also.    in recent days we have seen actions unprecedented in the history of el salvador.  there was the attack on workers in which 10 workers died and 31 were injured.  the fmln cannot ignore this fact.  this is part of the process.  we have said that we are going to establish contact with observers and mediators to analyze the situation, and we will discuss this process with the political parties and the social forces. what we want is to consolidate the negotiations process.  we are not trying to enhance our image; our people know who is telling the truth.    in san jose we made a solution proposal that envisages democracy, human rights, and a process to find a way out of the salvadoran conflict.  on monday and wednesday of next week we are going to meet in washington with oas and un representatives.  also on monday in san jose, costa rica, we could be in contact with the costa rican government to analyze the situation.    we will analyze developments to determine the position of the cristiani government.  if actions by the cristiani government close the possibilities of caracas, then we will adopt measures.  what we have done is to announce a suspension to create conditions for making progress toward real negotiations, as the san jose agreements establish.    (reporter) then why is the government going to caracas, commander?    (gonzalez) i believe that the announcement on the government delegation going to caracas is aimed at enhancing the government's  image, at creating a smoke screen around the massacre committed against the popular movement.    (reporter) now that you mention the fenastras massacre, what do you think about the creation of a commission to investigate this case that cristiani has announced?    (gonzalez) one of the points of our san jose proposal calls for changing the salvadoran legal system because it is vitiated and is in the hands of one single party.  so, in this framework, conducting an investigation is like putting the case inside a forgotten drawer. this is what happened to the monsignor romero case, the case of the revolutionary democratic front leaders, and the cases of thousands of workers who have been murdered and whose cases have been forgotten. the purpose of this commission is to create a smoke screen around the grave human rights violations being committed by the cristiani government.  we believe that the persons who have been invited to form part of this commission should not lend themselves to playing a part in the effort to hide what is really behind all this.  what the cristiani government wants is to divert away from emilio ponce all the accusations and charges, and ponce is the one who is directly involved in this kind of attack.  the state policy of the cristiani government is repression, and this state policy is being implemented by the cristiani government, cristiani, and the high command, and they are doing it through the repressive bodies, regardless of whether they function as civilians, as death squads, or in uniform.

decisions adopted during the session was to recruit minors, shantytown youths, and high school students \"to fight a guerrilla war in chile, because they have plenty of motivation.\"    this policy is outlined in documents and reports that those terrorist groups have circulated in shantytowns and among their members.  some of those documents and reports have been seized from boys who were arrested on charges of being directly involved in looting of commercial premises and in the bloody murders of carabineros personnel.    some of those documents say that \"socialist countries are our strategic allies,\" and that the movements identify themselves with \"the revolutionary form of struggle and with the struggle in the trenches that cuba, nicaragua, and el salvador have used\" to remain in the forefront of latin american socialism.    the two terrorist movements maintain that \"seizure\" of land, lootings, occupation of educational institutions, and \"the recovery of firearms\" are the main tactics to be undertaken by the masses in order to \"gain elbow room.\"    in the documents, the movements advocate the dissemination of violence within the masses, the adoption of defensive measures in order to begin an offensive, and \"a war by everyone\" as an inevitable step for taking over the country.    the movements maintain that \"the fact that the rebel elements have discovered their own geographical zone, the power of the masses, and the massive potential of youths, is one of the major achievements of the people's movement.\"    the documents emphasize the terrorist actions performed

\"implement the policy of the victory of the people's revolution.\"    as for the so-called \"war by everyone,\" the documents points out that \"in the chilean version, there are irregular forces with training in subversive tactics and strategy.\"    the movements maintain that their members operate in the streets, in education and labor centers, in high schools, and in shantytowns, adding that

the offensive, because the revolutions are fought in the streets and in the different regions of the country.\"    concerning the creation of the two movements (beginning in 1983), the documents state that \"our political-military proposal takes root in the \"war by everyone,\" a system which socialist countries and triumphant revolutions have used to defend themselves from imperialism.  the most intense expression of this policy has been reflected by the vietnamese revolution, by the sustained struggle in el salvador, and by the resistance to the spanish invasion by the mapuche people, under the leadership of lautaro. how to obtain weapons    in a document dealing with the \"revoltionary program for chile,\" the movements claim that \"our weapons are obtained through the people's initiative, through weapon seizures from the enemy (this is a clear allusion to the murder of carabineros, whose arms they seize), and through international solidarity.\"    the documents emphasize \"the offensive war which we are now waging seeks to asphyxiate the enemy, overwhelm it, and impede its initiative and the concentration of its forces.  we should always try to cause as much destructive damage to the enemy as possible.\"    the terrorists call on \"youths to wage this revolutionary struggle on a nationwide basis,\" adding that \"even though the heaviest burden rests on the cities, the country and rural areas are conducive to the installation of strategic facilities.\"    the report on the first national plenum (which is dated may 1989) has been especially dedicated

(changes thought) for that purpose we act based on article 167, no.  6, which reads: it is up to the council of ministers to suspend and restore the constitutional guarantees mentioned in article 29 of this constitution if the legislative assembly is not in session.

(30-second break in reception) this situation so they did not protect themselves in the face of the danger of a possible action such as this crime.    on the same night when the entire northern san salvador area was being bombed, the jesuits were killed.  what was their intention? they thought they were to obtain a military victory and set out to carry out a witch hunt.  they set out to kill all opposition members that one night, with the idea that they were going to wipe out the fmln, militarily.  based on that assumption, they decided to carry out this action to guarantee for themselves a few more years of stability through the peace of cemeteries, regardless of the consequences.    what really happened?  the day after they committed the crime, they launched their offensive to annihilate the fmln.  they thought this was going to be their decisive day, but the offensive failed.  their attack was repelled, they sustained many casualties, and loss much materiel.  their troops were further beaten and they did not obtain any effective military results.    consequently, their counteroffensive was rejected and the blow they thought they were going to deal to the leaders of the popular movement failed, on the one hand because some of these leaders were hiding and on the other because they committed an horrendous crime and it backfired.  it was a crime (word indistinct) by the general staff and mr. cristiani knew about it.  cristiani clearly (words indistinct) and probably even the u.s. embassy could be involved in this.  they thought that by killing all opposition members, they were going to achieve definite peace in el salvador.  this is very clear.  but this action backfired.  it was a painful incident, but it is an incident that is going to backfire for the government.  it is going to result in great isolation for the regime, at a moment when the fmln is stronger.  at a moment when the fmln has a political, military, and strategic advantage.    the murder of the jesuits is suicide for the regime.  i really do not understand it.  they made a very serious mistake.  in addition, they confirmed a truth we have been maintaining: they are fascists and assassins.  they must leave power.  they have created a situation in which the possibility for an fmln victory is great.  they have created a situation in which the disappearance of the most conservative oligarchic sectors of the salvadoran society will be caused by their own mistakes.

(samayoa) as i said, the u.s. government must take into consideration that a new internal situation of generalized popular, political, and social discontent is taking shape, and that from this moment on its policy in el salvador will undergo isolation and will be rejected by the american people, and even by very important sectors within the house and senate.    so far, the u.s. administration has stubbornly continued providing aid and support to a regime that is obviously criminal and genocidal, and that policy is (words indistinct) currently a very strong debate in the united states.  the options available to the u.s.  government are to sink with the cristiani regime, which is obviously moving toward defeat and military and political destruction despite all the propaganda it has made, or to change its opinion while there is still time.  the alternative of a change of government, a replacement of cristiani's regime or the military hierarchy, is already under discussion.  these, therefore, are the two alternatives available to the united states: either change its policy in time and replace cristiani, or the government will sink because its propaganda is not working.    the u.s. ambassador has made a fool of himself.  he said the guerrillas had 1,500 men in san salvador, and he has listed casualty figures according to which the fmln suffered over 500 deaths, over 400 wounded, and others captured.  according to the figures quoted by the u.s. ambassador, who provides government war bulletins and has almost become the salvadoran defense minister, the fmln only has 200 men left in san salvador.    what i find inexplicable is the government's need to use 40 or 50 war planes and helicopters, along with its artillery and elite battalions, to bomb and destroy cities, especially san salvador.  that is why their propaganda has backfired on them.  in the united states the press and general public know full well that the fmln offensive is in full force and is moving forward, and that the u.s.  policy is reaching the point of total failure.    (reporter) to conclude, comrade samayoa, what is your message on radio venceremos to the comrades who have maintained their positions in san salvador, san miguel, zacatecoluca, usulutan, and various points of the national territory?  what is your message to the fighters and the people?    (samayoa) to all the comrades who are fighting in trenches throughout the length and breadth of our country, i must say that the affection and admiration you have generated throughout the world, the solidarity with your struggle, and the surprising strength and heroism you have displayed are now receiving support from almost all of the countries of the world.  therefore, our struggle not only is not alone, but it has now achieved maximum support of all types: political, material, economic.  solidarity has multiplied hundredfold over the past few days, and it will be an inexhaustible source of support that will contribute to completing the fascist regime's destruction.  the people of the world admire the struggle the comrades and fighters in all the cities in this country are waging, and they very clearly understand that the struggle is for a just cause and against a completely illegitimate, fascist, and criminal regime.    the comrades can rest assured of this international support, which is currently very great.  it is impressive to see all of the affection and admiration that our fighters are receiving from all over the world.

(samayoa) at the level of the u.s. people, there is a total repudiation of the fascist criminal government and of the salvadoran armed forces because of the bombings -- which have become a true genocide -- in various densely populated cities and neighborhoods in el salvador, as well as because of the assassinations perpetrated by the salvadoran army against the jesuit priests at the central american university (uca).  there have been very radical demonstrations expressing much indignation by various u.s. social sectors.  moreover, in some of those demonstrations, the police barricades were broken. important u.s. political personalities such as jesse jackson, one of the most prestigious leaders in the united states, participated in the demonstrations.  there have also been demonstrations in boston, chicago, new york, san francisco, and los angeles.  in at least 20 cities in the united states people have expressed all their repudiation and indignation over the cristiani government and the u.s. policy in el salvador.    since the assassination of the uca priests, a large number of important u.s. senators and representatives are saying that u.s. military aid to the salvadoran armed forces and government should be cut and suspended.  senator kennedy in particular made a very strong statement, saying the salvadoran armed forces' attitude simply expresses the failure of 10 years of u.s. policy -- which has been spent feeding, training, arming, and financing an armed force that carries out assassinations.  in addition to senator kennedy, there are many u.s. senators and congressmen who are requesting the total suspension of military aid to el salvador.  at this time, the cristiani government and armed forces have the highest level of repudiation in the united states in the past 10 years.  however, the u.s. government, (words indistinct) the state department, and the white house continue supporting the (salvadoran) criminal regime and giving it further emergency aid.

it has organized the people.  the fmln does not forcefully recruit people.  therefore, it is not periodically renewing its ranks as the army does through forceful recruitment.  to the fmln, the main goal is to organize the people, to get as close as it can to the people.    because of the economic crisis, social injustice, and lack of democratic opportunities in (el) salvador, thousands of salvadorans have no other option than to take up arms and fight to achieve better living conditions in the face of the government's brutal repression, economic injustice, and unemployment.  to change this situation, thousands of salvadorans decided to take up arms and learn to wage war by fighting daiily.  that is the history of the fmln.    therefore, it cannot be said that two armies are fighting each other. the logistics apparatus of the fascist government' (armed) forces is not comparable to our forces.  they bring to our country tons of bombs, rifles, boots, and material through ports and military airports.  although the governments of nicaragua, cuba, and the ussr could help the fmln, as many are saying, the firepower of our forces could never be compared to the army's.    nevertheless, the fmln has opened in all countries, including the (united) states, the necessary ways for us to obtain our arms and ammunition.  we have the right to this.  how does the fmln learn to fight-- by fighting.  we are now fighting in cities.  every military analyst knows how difficult it is to fight in urban areas.  the fmln fighting in san salvador, san miguel, zacatecoluca, and usulutan has shown the organization's tremendous ability to wear out the enemy, take and hold positions, and maneuver in the city just as it has done in rural areas.  the fmln ability has surprised the military analysts at the pentagon.  our front has always had this ability.  but now we have changed our strategy and tactics to defeat the enemy plans.  the (armed) forces have a specific plan regarding the actions by patrols (words indistinct), special operations. the fmln had to change its strategy to strike at the small forces that tried to infiltrate our zone under cover.  only thus could we annihilate and defeat these forces and their strategy.  and this is what we did.  this is what must be observed, how the fmln has changed its military strategy to face the one used by the (armed) forces.  of course, we have accumulated great experience over the years, which we have applied these last days in combat in (san) salvador and (san) miguel.  armored personnel carriers are being destroyed in streets and avenues; helicopters are being shot down; soldiers are being taken prisoner; and arms are being seized.     military analysts are wondering how a guerrilla army can operate for so long in an urban area.  in addition, logistics must be taken into consideration.  the (armed) forces are constantly getting ammunition through the ilopango (air) base.  the fmln has been able to carry out this operation because of the people's support.  thousands of capital residents cooperated by keeping silent when they saw the guerrilla columns pass by.  they did not warn the (armed) forces.  why?  because the people see in these guerrilla columns their own army.", "extracts": {"PerpInd": [], "PerpOrg": [], "Target": [], "Victim": [], "Weapon": []}}

(applause)    the truth is that we should feel proud.  as a nicaraguan i feel proud that that murderous government has broken relations with nicaragua.  that is something to be proud of, because it means that they know perfectly well that we are on the side of the salvadoran people, on the side of the salvadoran peasant, on the side of the salvadoran worker, on the side of the salvadoran church and priests, that we are on the side of peace, justice, and democracy in el salvador, and that we oppose tyranny in el salvador.    i can see that the time has come for me to speak clearly to you.  i believe that it is necessary to speak clearly because diplomatic jargon can sometimes confuse things.  it is time that we speak clearly.  the least the nicaraguan government can do in response to the attitude assumed by the salvadoran government is to ask and demand of the international community and the world that it break relations with that murderous and criminal government until those who killed the priests have been punished, until those who are killing the salvadoran people have been punished.  (applause) that is what we are going to demand.  that is going to be our answer.    the international community is uneasy because of what is happening in el salvador.  cristiani is no tame dove.  he has become an accomplice and instrument of this policy of death implemented by the army, by men like (colonel rene emilio) ponce and (general juan rafael) bustillo.  they are murderous guardsmen just like those you knew, the somozist guardsmen.  bustillo, ponce, and a few others are just like that.  however, not all of them are like that. there are some honest soldiers in el salvador, soldiers with honest positions.

{"docid": "DEV-MUC3-0904", "doctext": "regarding the international scandal that the salvadoran government has made over an alleged shipment of surface-to-air missiles found inside a wrecked light aircraft, the fmln expresses the following:    1.  in view of a possible intensification of the salvadoran conflict, it is necessary to note that the salvadoran armed forces were the first ones to escalate the war by launching indiscriminate attacks and air bombings against the civilian population in densely populated urban areas.  the salvadoran armed forces had been doing this for several years in our country's rural areas.  in view of the damage that this causes the population, since 1987 the fmln has made proposals to scale down the war and suspend the use of aircraft and aviation equipment.    the salvadoran government's charges are hypocritical, as the government itself has turned aircraft into real instruments of genocide against the salvadoran people.    2.  the policy of the previous u.s. administration has turned central america into a huge arms market whereby thousands of tons of soviet and u.s. weapons, including surface-to air missiles, have been introduced into the area.  this has created a flourishing black market for weapons, where salvadoran and honduran military men and nicaraguan contras participate as big-time smugglers.    3.  the salvadoran government has begun a campaign of accusations against the nicaraguan government with the intention of putting up a smoke screen to cover the genocide it has unleashed and to divert the attention of the international community, which has been demanding:        a) that the salvadoran government stop the massive and indiscriminate attacks in densely populated urban areas and the persecution against the political opposition and grass roots movements;        b) an investigation to clear up the murder of six jesuit priests and two domestic workers, along with the punishment of those responsible for these and similar crimes; and,        c) that the salvadoran government accept the cease-fire it has heretofore rejected and justify its intransigent and irrational position.    4.  cristiani's decision to suspend relations with nicaragua based on an alleged shipment of missiles for the fmln is not reasonable, not even by saying that this represents an escalation of the salvadoran war.  in fact, the u.s. government has escalated the war by sending $4 billion in aid to strengthen the army and provide it with a powerful air force.    the justification has always been nicaragua's support to the fmln, thus refusing to admit the internal causes of the conflict and also keeping the doors closed to any negotiations.  this has unnecessarily prolonged the salvadoran people's suffering and has        made more dramatic their legitimate struggle for a true democratic, pluralist, and non-aligned government.    based on the above, we reiterate:    1.  that we consider absolutely legitimate our right to obtain all types of weapons to guarantee our defense and to protect our people from the (word indistinct) military escalation promoted by the salvadoran government with the firm support of the previous and present u.s. governments.  this includes the right to obtain weapons from various sources and to guarantee their arrival at our war fronts through any means available.    2.  we maintain our total willingness to de-escalate the war.  we begin by expressing that we are totally willing to agree on a cease-fire with international supervision and to begin real negotiations to end the war with the participation of all the nation's political and social forces.    3.  we are willing to refrain from using the surface-to-air missiles if the air force calls a complete halt to its bombings, strafing, and machinegunning throughout the national territory.

{"docid": "DEV-MUC3-0920", "doctext": "fellow patriots, i am addressing the nation today to explain the government's position concerning the issue of extradition, which was the subject of a very intense debate last night at the chamber of representatives' first commission.    a proposal was put forward to the effect that in the extraordinary referendum scheduled for 21 january -- which is contemplated in the constitutional reform that is currently in its final stages -- an additional question be included with regard to whether or not you, the colombian people, want colombian criminals to be extradited.    this question would join four other issues that had already been approved for submission to popular consultation on 21 january.  on behalf of the national government, the government minister immediately expressed the disadvantages of approving that proposal.    i have consulted with former presidents alberto lleras, carlos lleras restrepo, alfonso lopez, and julio cesar turbay about including the extradition issue in the referendum, and they feel that with the current public order situation, especially when the government has been dealing successfully with the struggle against drug trafficking, it would be disadvantageous to use the referendum to decide on extradition.    the country must not deceive itself as to where we would be headed if we held a referendum on the issue of extradition, and as to the fatal consequences of such an action on the country's morale and on democracy's survival.    initially, i am not talking about extraditing colombian criminals for them to stand trial in other countries, but of extraditing drug traffickers who have committed crimes abroad.  extradition is not punishment for society because it refers only to drug traffickers, neither is it an affront to sovereignty, as some people have tried to portray it.    extradition has been dealt with in colombian international treaties.  the direction of international policy lies within the exclusive realm of the presidency of the republic, according to the constitution.  congress cannot take the initiative of abolishing public extradition treaties by resorting to legislative or constituent provisions.  this is clear in light of colombian public law, and it is imperative according to the vienna convention, which colombia recently approved.  according to this convention, the extradition treaty will prevail over internal provisions.  in other words, the treaties that colombia has signed with regard to extradition cannot be disregarded through internal legislation.  this can only be done through diplomatic efforts such as denouncing the treaties and directly informing the counterpart.    for 100 years colombian law has authorized the extradition of criminals.  i repeat, 100 years, since 1888, and only now, when extradition is applied to drug traffickers, are there objections to its alleged violations of sovereignty.  practically all the countries of the world, with very few exception, have and apply treaties to extradite terrorists or whomever commits crimes against humanity, such as drug trafficking.    over the past 10 years, no more than 30 people have been extradited to several countries that requested the extraditions and complied with the necessary laws.  therefore, extradition is not a general threat against all colombians.  it only affects those who have committed the crime of drug trafficking abroad.  secondly, some people have said that extradition has created violence and, therefore, with its elimination, violence would disappear.  neither is true.    the violence perpetrated by drug traffickers had been suffered prior to the 1979 extradition treaty.  after the treaty went into effect, hundreds of colombians were murdered, including justice minister rodrigo lara bonilla.  in december 1986, a supreme court decision left the extradition treaty inapplicable.  in other words, after this, while extradition was inapplicable, attorney general carlos mauro hoyos was slain, bogota mayor andres pastrana was kidnapped, and newsman guillermo cano, political leader jaime pardo leal, and hundreds of colombians were sacrificed.

{"docid": "DEV-MUC3-0926", "doctext": "the political negotiations that resulted in jaime paz zamora's installation as president of the republic will again take place in the next weeks to decide who will be installed as mayor of la paz.    the municipal elections held yesterday did not clearly indicate who will be the mayor of the country's biggest city, where the candidates of the populist new political groups and those of the traditional parties received approximately the same number of votes.    according to unofficial returns released by the private television channels, which in previous elections have proven to be very similar to those of the national electoral court, carlos palenque, 45, a radio and television businessman and the leader of the conscience of the fatherland (condepa), has received most of the votes.    palenque received 39.9 percent of the votes cast in la paz, thereby giving condepa 5 of the 13 seats on the town council, which will elect the mayor of la paz on 2 january.    the alliance of the right wing nationalist democratic action (adn) and the social democratic movement of the revolutionary left (mir) has also won five town council seats.    ronald maclean, 40 and of scottish ancestry, the mayoral candidate of the adn-mir alliance, has obtained 36.8 percent of the votes in la paz, where he has been the mayor since l985.    far behind were the former administration's party, the nationalist revolutionary movement (mnr), which received two seats, and the populist solidarity civic union (ucs), led by brewery owner max fernandez, with one town council seat.    the decision as to who will be the new la paz mayor on 2 january is now in the hands of the mnr, but its leaders declined to comment on their position last night.    gonzalo sanchez de losada, the leader of the mnr, last night said on television: \"we must be extremely serious in searching for a solution to this problem, or the people will turn their backs on populism.\"    he said his decision will be \"a christmas present.\"  he insisted, however, that in his opinion the governing adn-mir alliance \"will easily fix things between them\" because \"they are two of a kind.\"    although the mnr was the party to receive most of the votes in the 7 may presidential elections, it was due to an alliance between two old political enemies -- the adn and mir -- that jaime paz zamora, who had come third in the elections, was installed as president of the republic. \"if we applied this same rule to the current problem,\" sanchez de losada said jokingly, \"guido capra (mnr candidate for mayor of la paz) would be elected.\"    sanchez de losada pointed out that palenque was one of the supporters of the adn-mir governing alliance, which prevented sanchez de losada from becoming president.    according to the opposition, palenque's party gained the la paz development corporation (cordepaz) and \"half a ministry\" (referring to the communications and transportation ministry) as a result of the alliance.  sanchez de losada warned the bolivian politicians that palenque's populist group, which is growing very fast, has its eyes set \"on the l993 presidential elections, not only on the la paz mayorship.\"    while respect was shown toward ronald maclean, the candidate most criticized by the mnr during the municipal elections campaign was palenque.    palenque stated, however, that the councilmen who on 2 january will elect the next mayor of la paz must \"respect the will of the majority.\"    \"we hope that there will be no negotiation (among parties) and that the desire of the majority will be respected,\" palenque stated.  he is well known, especially because of the beard he wears, which makes him look very much like former u.s. president abraham lincoln.    palenque, who is certain of the support he will receive from the only ucs councilman in la paz, fears that a pact between the adn-mir coalition and the mnr will prevent him from obtaining the mayorship of the most important city in the country.    such an alliance, however, with a greater ideological basis than any other, will have to overcome the grudge that the mnr bears because the adn and the mir \"had stolen from it\" the presidency of the republic during the last elections, according to commentators.    \"we are going to be very responsible, and we are not going to be motivated by personal interests or by any vengeance,\" sanchez de losada stated, commenting on the negotiations that will take place to designate the mayor of la paz.    like in la paz, the government alliance will have to negotiate support in the other major bolivian cities, where the coalition came in first but failed to win absolute majorities.    the only exception is sucre, where the candidate of the united left coalition, radio reporter omar montalvo, obtained 57.3 percent of the votes, which is sufficient to obtain the mayorship.    the most outstanding points about the elections were the abstention of between 30 and 50 percent of the voters and the almost absolute normalcy during the elections.    the state of siege decreed throughout the country on 15 november due to street confrontations caused by social disturbances did not hamper the electoral process.    the traditional restrictions, however, affected traffic and hampered public transportation, keeping

(wheelock apparently shows location on a map).    the names of the boats are \"kerry mac ii\", \"davis jr,\" \"miss patsy,\" and another one called \"tie water\" (number of boats as heard).  the boats were captured and taken to isla del maiz.  in each boat there were five nicaraguan soldiers, one air force officer, and one navy officer.  as the boats were taken to isla del maiz, the members of the \"miss patsy\" crew, who numbered approximately 60, mutinied against the sandinist officers on board.    the ship's captain and a cook disarmed one of the soldiers and killed him.  as a result of the confrontation, the cook was killed, but the captain was unharmed.  after the mutiny was over, and at approximately 0.7 miles from corn, i mean isla del maiz, the ship's captain ran the \"miss patsy\" fishing boat aground on some reef near isla del maiz grande and we were forced to, let us say, save all the people on board and take them to corn island.    one of the \"miss patsy\" sailors jumped off the ship and we have been unable to find him.  of the two bodies, that of the army officer and the cook, we have only been able to recover the cook's body because the ship sank.  most of the other people were taken to hospitals in bluefields and others are being held by the sandinist navy.  that is more or less what happened.    when the \"miss patsy\" ran aground, the crew members of the other ships came to help, and during this time, apparently, the ship called \"davis jr\" managed to escape.  we have been unable to find it, but we want to tell you that the following eps officers are on that boat: air force first lieutenant victor rodriguez hernandez, lt juan carlos galo tinoco, navy sailor jose marcelino reyes, and sailor jose rene rodriguez.    we do not know what happened to the \"davis jr,\" but we believe it returned to honduras.  that is more or less what happened.  i am now ready to answer the questions that you may want to ask.

(montenegro) the truth is that the reasons why the fmln began its offensive on 11 november 1989 have not changed at all.  thus, the fmln cannot stop its offensive.  on the contrary, what happened in el salvador is that the fmln offensive strategically turned the war. that turn included a number of military, political, and diplomatic implications.    thus, the truth is that the agreement signed in san isidro de coronado did not propose realistic negotiations for the conflict. yesterday, 12 december, the fmln issued a communique which vehemently expressed its absolute rejection of the agreement signed at the presidential summit.  at present, the fmln believes that despite what the other four central american presidents say, it is clearer than ever that the salvadoran government is a fascist, military dictatorship.  the salvadoran government violates people's human rights and that fact has been clearly proved to the entire international community.  therefore, any attempt to help the salvadoran government or any kind of support given to it nothing but a piece of paper that does not have too much validity to the fmln.    (bernard) in other words comrade, the fmln will maintain the same level of confrontation with the dictatorship?    (montenegro) i believe the fmln's armed struggle is now more legitimate than ever.  the summit confirmed the legitimacy of the fmln's struggle, because the agreement resulting from that summit is neither feasible nor real.  the fmln will therefore continue its political - military offensive.  the fmln will increase its actions. the fmln is reorganizing (readecuar) its political - military apparatus.  in the next few days, we will clearly show what the fmln can do.  the fmln will not surrender its weapons, especially now.  the fmln has no obligation to abide by an agreement that does not reflect the salvadoran reality at all.    if the central american presidents chose to close their eyes to what is going on that is really their problem.    (bernard) two days after the end of the central american summit, what is the current military situation in el salvador?    (montenegro) as i told you earlier in answering the first question, the first thing is that the fmln definately changed the war.  this means that the fmln made the salvadoran armed forces retreat from the mountains to the heart of the cities including the capital city of san salvador.    at present, we have almost absolute control over the highways in 14, i mean 12 salvadoran departments.  there have been actions in ahuachapan and sonsonate, two departments that had been almost untouched by the war.    there is a strategic siege in san salvador.  the army has 65 percent of its forces stationed in san salvador.  the army has abandoned large areas.    as for sabotage operations, at present there are 10 110,000-volt primary lines that are out of service.  that represents a 40-percent energy deficit in the country.  there have been long periods of 100-percent power outages in san salvador.  it is very unlikely that the government can control that situation.  we do not know how long they will endure it.  but in any case, a strong blow by the fmln forces is expected to occur somewhere in el salvador at any time.

(cabral) today, 11 december, after 1 month of a glorious and victorious offensive, we have some thoughts regarding this latest fight.  we want to stress that all our offensives have centered around the main cities in our country.  one of the most important and significant achievements of this struggle by the people and the fmln is having maintained the besiegement on the most important political and economic points, most especially on the country's capital.  there has been great pressure in the case of san salvador, and the fmln has forced the joint chiefs of staff, colonel ponce, and the fascist high command to change their strategic tactics three times.    you will recall that the joint chiefs of staff first tried to dislodge the fmln forces that had entered since the evening of 11 november.  when the first puppet army strategic defense tactic failed, they then tried to isolate the fmln forces from one another and annihilate them one by one.  for this, they concentrated special forces, especially using elite battalions, in a siege modality for annihilation.  this also failed.  faced with the second failure of their special tactics to end the offensive in a few days, as cristiani and the high military command had said, they moved a great number of operational forces from the country's interior, such as the elite battalions, to set up an extensive siege to defend the capital city and prevent our forces from entering it.  as all our people have been able to see -- and international public opinion has also been able to verify this through a great amount of information flowing through international reporters -- that siege to keep out the fmln has also failed.  this means more victories and successes, such as incursions into the escalon neighborhood and the southern area of antiguo cuscatlan, and two important attacks on the joint chiefs of staff.    right now we see that the puppet army's special city operation is their third and last plan.  they have formed four commands to control the city, which will also be defeated by our fmln military forces.  we also must add to this list of achievements that the great concentration of enemy army operational forces in the capital has caused a great national imbalance in forces.  this means that extensive areas of the country are without the protection of the puppet troops.  we have taken advantage of this and have worked on organizing the people and raising a people's power, an alternative to local reactionary power.    we also record as a successful offensive during this first month the fact that our enemy's intelligence work has been completely smashed.  the searches, which have been entrusted in an improvised manner to military troops concentrated in the cities, especially the repressive corps, have attempted to restore all the intelligence data banks to be able to try and destroy the people's struggle.  we must also record as one of the successes of our general offensive during this first month the fact that the puppet army was forced to abort another plan.  even though there were some bloody events, such as the murder of the jesuit priests, along with a great amount of kidnappings and missing people and arrests of members or leaders of grassroot people's movements, we feel that the army and repressive corps are incapable of attending to the fmln offensive and the besiegement at the same time that they are trying to carry out their annihilation of the people's movement.  so this is another success.

(bravo) thank you mr president.  president paz zamora, i am going to ask you the same question.  in your opinion, and taking into account the increasing impoverishment in latin america, population explosion, the drug trafficking problem, the current latin american economic growth, and the foreign debt problem, about which in fact i think i heard -- and i say i think, because it was too early in the morning -- over the eco latin american television network this morning that you are solving the foreign debt problem, what is latin america's future for the last decade of this century?    (paz) my friend napoleon bravo, i have a fairly optimistic viewpoint with regard to latin america's future for this last decade of the century.  i believe we must admit that despite all the difficulties, the foreign debt problem, the misery that exists on our continent, the population explosion, and other problems, since the latin american republics were formed, our continent has never been better than today.  in other words, since the latin american republics were formed, we have never had almost 90 percent of the continent living within democratic systems as we do now.  we have never had the perspectives we had today.  i am optimistic about the future of my country, of latin america, and especially of our three countries.    i am so optimistic that i even want to point out something that touches our souls.  we will begin the decade by winning the world soccer championship in italy.  we must not underestimate soccer, because soccer is culture, too, and represents our peoples' strength.    taking into account that mine is an optimistic point of view, i would like to tell you that over the next 10 years, latin america will face a number of problems.  one of those problems will be to find a way to rejoin an economic, financial, and commercial world from which latin america was gradually expelled during the last decade and even during the 1970's.

(changes thought) i wish to point out that it is not a sandinist company; it might have very little sympathy for sandinism, but it is apparently a reliable company.  it gives the fsln a majority of 51 percent, and the national opposition union (uno) -- one of the political forces participating in the electoral contest -- 24 percent.    other polls that have been taken have given the fsln close to 69 percent, as opposed to uno, to which they attributed 27 percent.  yet, what is being said?  that there will be electoral fraud.  therefore, that charge and others that have been made, like this one which greatly bothers me, to the effect that we are harboring subversive groups for them to come to honduras... (changes thought) i can guarantee to the honduran armed forces and to the new honduran government that in nicaragua we will not take a single step in that direction.

(reporter) (question indistinct)    (garcia) yes, i think that that magazine is well informed, because there have been some misunderstandings.  as you know, experts from the four countries met in santa cruz de la sierra, bolivia, to prepare a document.  when everything seemed to be ready to sign the final document, one of the countries proposed some modifications changing the structure of the concept.    the first time i went to the united nations, 4 and 1/2 years ago, i told the united states that this is not a problem of helicopters or bullets.  this is a problem of better prices for cocoa, coffee, and annatto seeds.  this is a problem with the processing factories in the higher huallaga valley area and airlines that transport these products to the united states.    this concept has been accepted after 4 and 1/2 years; when it was finally about to be put down in the document in santa cruz, one of the countries modified it, thus hindering further progress in the negotiations.  this subject is now being reviewed, and the summit could be postponed for a few days until we reach full agreement on such an important summit, which was proposed by the peruvian presidency.    we must gather at the cartagena summit with a concrete proposal. it cannot be simply a social gathering.  we are not teenagers who are attending the meeting simply because the president of the most important country in the world will be there.  we cannot go there as desperate and dazzled youngsters to hold his hand.  we must make concrete proposals to obtain funds for peru, work and honor for the huallaga valley peasants, and respect for the latin american countries, particularly since it is clear that the origin of the problem is in the consumers of the rich countries, especially the united states.

(garcia) yes, we heard about this and are analyzing it.  but the problem of the 200,000 hectares used for illegal coca growing by far exceeds the capacity of the agrarian bank, of the national coca leaf enterprise (empresa nacional de la coca), or the enci to finance fertilizer.  this is a subject that must be discussed at the continental level.  the huallaga valley is an enclave of the u.s. consumers.  it is a perverse problem with economic repercussions and it is distorting and destroying the possibility of our planting other crops in that area.  this is why we must consider it from a continental viewpoint, discussing it with the country where the problem originates, where it is consumed.  the enci and the agrarian bank problem is important, but it is very small in comparison to the seriousness of the overall problem.    (reporter) mr. president, is it true -- as it was said in the united states -- that the peruvian government is refusing to replace the plantations because it is not economically convenient?    (garcia) no, according to solid information i have at hand from the state department and the department in charge of drug trafficking, our government has made the greatest efforts during the past few years to eradicate coca plantations.  a few months ago they released a report to the u.s. media from may 1989 that showed that peru had broken all records for eradicating coca in 1988, in keeping with its international agreements.  peru eradicated more than 5,000 hectares of coca plantations that year, thus stabilizing the overall amount of hectares used for coca growing.  nobody, much less the united states, can say that peru has done nothing.    we have carried out vast operations and have continued our silent task to eradicate these plantations, sometimes with regrettable consequences.  the peasant who is faced with bare land after the coca is uprooted either engages in terrorist activities or is condemned to live in misery.  this is why we need an overall economic and social development alternative that must be part of a reevaluated latin american-u.s. relationship.    (reporter) mr. president, the situation is now the opposite to what the united states is doing for (words indistinct) a meeting put forward by the presidents, because they give $1 to fight drug trafficking while there are $100 for consumption.    (garcia) you are right.  it is believed that the total cost of cocaine sold on the u.s. streets is $100 billion.  only $8 or $9 million is being offered to fight the illegal production of coca and  to replace the crops here in peru.  what the united states -- the        main consumer -- has been offering is not proportional to the magnitude of the problem.    if there were no consumption in the united states, peru would not produce coca leaves, except for the traditional, ancient uses of peruvian people.  the problem begins there.  the responsibility for providing massive resources should be assumed through concerted dialogue, not unilateral measures, because there are hawks in the united states.  the hawks are the boldest militarists who believe that troops can be sent to the huallaga valley, thus solving this serious problem.    such an action would represent the violation of a nation's sovereignty, an unwanted unilateral intervention.  we want a serious, responsible, concerted, far-reaching socioeconomic policy.  this is our objective for cartagena.    (reporter) mr. president, changing the subject, the electoral campaign has entered the final stretch.  opposition parties have constantly mentioned your name and what you have said or have not said.  what is your opinion of the campaign?

{"docid": "DEV-MUC3-1111", "doctext": "britain and argentina tonight agreed to resume full diplomatic relations which were broken off in 1982 after the invasion of the falkland islands. the announcement was made tonight in london, buenos aires and madrid, where two days of talks between senior officials have hammered out the deal.  the foreign office stressed the decision would have no effect on british sovereignty of the falklands, where 1,000 britons were killed and wounded during the war.    britain has agreed to lift the 150-mile military protection zone around the falklands from march 31.  at the same time new mutually agreed security arrangements will come into force.  these will involve 25 days advance notification by each side of military manoeuvres in certain areas.  it has also been agreed there should be 48-hours notice for naval ships which want to approach closer to the coast than 50 nautical miles and 70 nautical miles for aircraft.    full diplomatic relations will come into force as soon as the protecting powers for the two countries have been informed.  britain's interests in argentina have been represented by switzerland since 1982.  argentina's interests in london have been represented by brazil from the same period.    talks on fisheries around the falklands will continue.  a working group on south atlantic affairs is to be set up.  its first meeting will take place within the next 12 months.  an argentine visit to war cemeteries in the falklands will be allowed to go ahead.  this will be worked out through the international red cross.    both sides have also agreed that visas requirements will be abolished.  britain and argentina have also agreed to cooperate on drugs and the environment.    the british delegation to the talks was led by sir crispin tickell, ambassador to the united nations and the argentine delegation by senor garcia del solar, special representative of president carlos menem.    the agreement is the outcome of a series of contacts between the two countries over the past few months.  in october, it was agreed to establish consular relations.  air links between buenos aires and london resumed a few weeks ago.  a party of british mps and prominent public figures have just returned from buenos aires after the inaugural flight by british airways.  an obstacle to the resumption of relations over the past few years was the argentine refusal to declare that hostilities between the two countries were at an end.  however, the newly-elected argentine government made clear last year that such hostilities could now be considered at an end.  britain, after talks last october, agreed to raise no obstacles to argentine efforts to establish closer trading relations with the european community.  the argentine economy is now seen to be in a severe plight.  president menem has watched his popularity decline as argentina inflation has remained at a high level.    britain and argentina will also establish a direct communication link between their respective military authorities.  the purpose is to reduce the possibility of incidents and to limit their consequences if such incidents should occur.  according to the statement, this hotline will increase common knowledge of military activities in the south atlantic.  the link will be under the supervision of the argentine and british foreign ministries.  british ministers have made clear that adequate defence arrangements will be maintained for the falklands.    foreign office minister timothy sainsbury returned to london last weekend after a visit to the falklands where he reassured islanders there was no weakening in britain's commitment to their defence.    foreign secretary douglas hurd tonight described the agreement with argentina as \"very satisfactory\" and that it \"underlines the fact that we have no quarrel with argentina\".  he said: \"this has been achieved without any sacrifice of sovereignty.  i hope it is a turning point that will lead to a new relationship between britain and argentina.\" mr hurd told reporters at the foreign office: \"i hope that trade between britain and argentina can be accelerated.  it is for the falkland islanders to decide on their own contacts with the mainland.\"    asked if the instability in argentina might lead to a new attempt to seize the falklands, he said: \"i think that is becoming less and less likely.\"  he expressed appreciation that the readiness of the government in argentina to make this advance which britain had reciprocated.  \"the outcome is very satisfactory,\" he said.  the british protection zone had been replaced \"with something from a security point of view that is better.  we have replaced it with an advance notification system on the approach of ships and aircraft. that from a security viewpoint is an improvement.\"  he hoped that the agreement would be well received in the falklands and noted that the falkland islanders had already been given an assurance of britain's continued commitment.    the exchange of ambassadors and the ending of visas would take place quite soon.    asked if sovereignty of the falklands could ever be discussed with argentina he said: \"i do not see how that can be discussed by us given the history and principle that is involved.\"    labour welcomed the move to resume full diplomatic relations.  mr george foulkes, a front bench spokesman on foreign affairs, said it meant the two countries were now almost back to their respective positions before the 1982 conflict.  but he added: \"we must now pull out all the stops in developing trade relations between our two countries.\"  this included considering all opportunities for british investment in argentina and the development of cultural, sporting and other links.", "extracts": {"PerpInd": [], "PerpOrg": [], "Target": [], "Victim": [], "Weapon": []}}
{"docid": "DEV-MUC3-1112", "doctext": "the santa cruz preparatory meeting was held under strict security measures and its conclusions have been kept under strict secrecy. this veil of secrecy seemed to have been lifted when the morning newspaper hoy published a long agenda under the heading \"total war against drug trafficking.\"  the government, however, has neither confirmed nor rejected the authenticity of the report.  (silence is golden).  at a meeting at the interior minister's office on 31 january, the minister told coca producers that hoy did not report the preliminary agenda...  and that the president's criterion of \"coca in return for development\" has prevailed.  if this is the case, and if there is consensus on this position, why hasn't the country been informed?    the situation has been further complicated by the remarks by peruvian president alan garcia, who said that \"when everything seemed to have been agreed upon\" one of the countries introduced changes that have \"changed the structural features of the issue.\"  what is this new concept?  is it about sovereignty or independence?    the progovernment propaganda has monotonously reiterated over the past few days that to govern means to inform.  fine.  we agree that to inform is part of the art of governing.  to inform, however, also means to tell the truth, especially if it deals with an issue that is fundamental to the future of bolivians.  the government should be consistent, at least with this principle.    president jaime paz zamora has repeatedly proposed the replacement of coca production through development programs.  yet the remarks by u.s. embassy deputy chief of mission marilyn mcafee have dealt an anticipated blow that has caused some officials to hesitate.  \"there is $15 million for replacement,\" she said.  (there is $60 million for repression).  barely recuperated from his surprise, the foreign minister said that the u.s. help is a \"bilateral issue and, consequently, it will not be directly addressed\" at the cartagena summit.  the interior minister, who has more experience in this type of situation, did not attach much importance to mcafee's statement and stressed that \"more exact figures will be mentioned at the cartagena summit.\"  who is telling the truth?  will the cartagena summit address the economic aid?    after this peculiar situation, the united states seems to have chosen interdiction and eradication -- repression -- to fight drug trafficking.  the strategy of \"war against drug trafficking terrorists\" has prevailed.  this strategy lends itself to interventionist military policies, similar to the presence of u.s. marines in bolivia in the past, or, in the future, the creation of a multinational military force that would jeopardize regional political and military stability.    when the trafficking of cocaine was carried out as a covert operation (1984-87) involving the cia and the u.s. army -- for the purpose of providing military supplies to the contras -- cocaine trafficking was not a crime.  the links between noriega and drug trafficking were a matter of secondary importance as long as he provided information and support for their war against nicaragua.  but now the united states does not mind invading panama or turning colombia into an inferno to capture noriega or some of the major colombian traffickers on this crusade against drug trafficking.  that is the u.s. government's double-faced morality.    another scandal hit u.s. society last week.  marion barry, the mayor of washington, the capital of the empire and also the capital of crime, was caught in an fbi trap.  he was filmed consuming cocaine. his followers claim that it is a white conspiracy to prevent a black mayor from running for another term.    but the interesting point for us is the controversy between bennett, the u.s. government strategist for the struggle against drug trafficking (the bennett plan), and washington police chief fulwood. while bennett has questioned the efficiency of the washington police, claiming that this area receives the largest amount of federal support for the struggle against drug trafficking, fulwood has said that bennett is wasting time \"talking without doing absolutely anything\" (newsweek, 29 january).  the newsweek journalist said that even before the barry scandal it was possible to see that the bennett plan had become \"only a dirty battle of words.\"  bennett's strategy for the prevention and repression of drug abuse in the united states has been a total failure.  bennett therefore believes that the best way to cover his failure is to turn toward latin america to relieve the fury of his impotence, ordering warships and planes to control maritime and air traffic.  as usual, those of us who live in the \"backyard\" have to pay for the mistakes of u.s. policy.    this is not a story of suspense.  the suspense has been created by the attitude of the government.  the country needs to know the conclusions of the santa cruz summit.  otherwise we will have to accept that a smoke screen has been deployed over the cartagena summit.", "extracts": {"PerpInd": [], "PerpOrg": [], "Target": [], "Victim": [], "Weapon": []}}

(garcia) it is not easy to change it for coffee, tobacco, cacao, annatto, or palm trees.  the u.s. government has studied all this. i have a 600-page report from the u.s. government that discusses the alternatives for replacing the 80,000 hectares in the guayaga valley -- which is the largest coca-producing area in the country.  it would cost $600 million to industrialize the area on a long-term basis.    (amat) but, mr. president, coca practically grows wild; it does not require much work in the countryside.  how can a government like yours convince a farmer to invest much more money in a product that would be much less profitable?    (reporter) let me add something to that...    (garcia, interrupting) excuse me.  it is a vicious circle.  the peasant produces coca because he has no money.  i will not ask him to invest money he does not have to change the product.  the united states has to buy the new product to achieve this.  the united states has to guarantee that it will buy the product.  look, how many trillions does the united states buy as imports in other countries? a fraction of this would change the destiny of colombia, peru, and bolivia.    the united states should say: if i buy $600 billion in products abroad, i will buy $10 billion -- of anything -- in peru, colombia, and bolivia.  it could be tomatoes, palm oil, coffee, chocolate bars, anything.  this would change the history of these countries.

{"docid": "DEV-MUC3-1129", "doctext": "on the evening of 20 may 1986, the jenka, a danish cargo ship with an empty hold, was anchored in valparaiso bay.    the ship, which was specially fitted to carry weapons, had been \"waiting into line\" for 120 days, meaning -- in port operation jargon -- that it was waiting for its turn or for the arrival of its cargo.    the five-man crew was uneasy. they were waiting for a shipment of 400 \"wasp\" cluster bombs produced by ferrimar (expansion unknown) -- a subsidiary of famae (army ordnance) -- and bound for the middle east. the destination of the shipment was iran. the users: the armed forces of imam ruhollah khomeini.    the secret shipment was having problems on land.    the five crew members made a decision that night, taking on fuel and food and fleeing toward panama. in the dark no one noticed the ship's departure, not the shipping company that was in charge of the ship nor the port's captain -- a navy officer who was supposed to authorize the move. the jenka left an unpaid debt of $30,000 owed to the shipping company.    the case was reported by the press and ferrimar rushed to say that it was selling weapons to pakistan and nigeria. it was also said that the government, for ethical reasons, would not allow the enterprise to offer the \"wasp\" bombs to iran. in fact, chilean businessman carlos cardoen was already selling \"clusters\" (preceding word in english) to iraq. doing business at the expense of the two sides confronting each other in the long persian gulf war was not considered appropriate.    the deal, however, was attractive because there could be millions of dollars in profits. countries like brazil and the ussr were known to be selling weapons to both iran and iraq. the ussr was directly selling weapons to iraq and supplying iran through middlemen. chile knew of a similar example: during the beagle channel conflict, which almost ended in a war with argentina, israel sold missiles to both sides.    therefore, in a carefully planned operation, ferrimar and famae were able to sell cluster bombs to iran.    the middleman would be frenchman bernard stroiazzo, the same person who three years later would cause the \"iran-corfo\" (production development corporation) scandal (hoy, no. 655).    it is only now that stroiazzo's history has been made public. an engineer hired by iran's national petroleum company, he served as a representative of ferrimar and famae to the iranian government in the sale of cluster bombs in 1986. after two shipments of defective bombs, the iranians decided that they could cause more casualties among their own men than among enemy troops. stroiazzo was taken hostage for 18 months.    he managed to leave and traveled to chile. with the help of cni (national intelligence center) director brigadier general hugo salas, he contacted corfo officials who helped him arrange compensation. he arranged a preliminary accord for establishing a toxic waste recycling plant in chile, but the deal failed. he then filed a lawsuit against corfo in the 19th civil court of santiago.  corfo has not yet been notified of the lawsuit. the problem, at least as far as the toxic waste plant is concerned, will be inherited by the new government -- which will take over on 11 march -- and by corfo.    did ferrimar lie to the chilean government?    this enterprise was known to have good contacts with the authorities. among the partners of ferrimar owner aldo pesce were retired general manuel contreras sepulveda, former chief of the national intelligence directorate, dina; general raul reyes, famae director, and colonel carlos carreno, who was a famae executive and an adviser to ferrimar on the production of the \"wasp\" bombs. (a lawsuit filed with the 14th criminal court of santiago under \"robbery of industrial secrets\" charges claims that the bombs were built with plans stolen from carlos cardoen by one of cardoen's trusted men.)    to export its bombs, ferrimar needed the authorization of the defense and foreign ministries. the company had to provide what is known in the international weapons market is known as an \"end-user certificate\" or \"final-user certificate.\" ferrimar got one. it was signed in august 1985 by a nigerian army officer who, according to sources close to the case, had retired a long time ago. a \"triangle operation\" was carried out to conceal the true operation. it is not known whether the defense ministry has indicted anyone over the deception by which it was victimized.    at the end of january 1986, the first 100 bombs were shipped by plane to bandar abbas airport in iran. each bomb weighed 227 kg and contained 248 ammunition packages, some of them for immediate discharge and others for delayed action.  these were capable of mining large areas for up to 72 hours after a battle.    the first shipment was worth $7 million; $1 million was for stroiazzo and $1.5 million went for the cost of the bombs. the price of the bombs abroad was $14,000 each, but their real cost was only $3,000. the chilean contact in this operation, fernando perez, was to have received $4.5 million.    a test was performed in iran and the bombs did not work. the iranian defense ministry asked that new tests be carried out in chile.

{"docid": "DEV-MUC3-1134", "doctext": "the annals of the colombian port of cartagena list three extremely fierce sieges.  back in 1586, the \"jewel of the caribbean\" was captured by sir francis drake, who did not burn the city to the ground only because he received a ransom of 10 million pesos.  a century later cartagena was occupied by the french.  finally, in 1741, the city's defenders successfully fought off an assault by a host of 27,000 pirates headed by sir edward vernon...    the western press described the meeting between the presidents of the united states, bolivia, colombia, and peru held a few days ago in cartagena as a kind of assault.  despite some exaggeration, this graphic description was based on perfectly serious grounds.  after all, the conference did discuss immediate tasks and even a detailed schedule for a joint offensive by the governments of these countries against criminal drug trafficking, which ranks first in the pecking order of crime.    it is indeed necessary to launch an assault against the drug mafia's strongholds, whether in medellin, \"famous\" for unbridled gangsterism, or in cartagena itself, whose status as a resort is threatened by the selfsame \"cocaine barons.\"  as a matter of fact, this tourist center has been repeatedly shaken in recent months by the explosions of bombs planted by terrorists in the \"hilton\" hotel, in stores, or at its marinas.  it is no wonder, as reuter reports, that not a single cruise ship has dropped anchor there this season.    yes, the situation is highly alarming, and this applies to the whole of colombia and even to the entire region.  in these conditions the firm resolve displayed by the participants in the cartagena meeting deserves understanding and support: the resolve to finally pool their efforts in the struggle against organized crime and to jointly place a reliable barrier in its path.  these are the intentions shown in the joint statement signed by the four presidents and by the series of special documents.    the aim of these agreements is noble indeed: to besiege the drug mafia in its nests, to cut off the \"laundering\" of drug dollars, and to deprive the merchants of \"slow death\" of broad access to the \"black market\" in the united states, where, as a matter of fact, the lion's share of south america's poisonous export is consumed.  in other words, an important step has been taken to combat one of the main \"evils of the 20th century,\" and it was not for nothing that the meeting's results were positively appraised by un secretary general j. perez de cuellar.    here is a different question: emphasis in cartagena was placed on administrative and police measures and on washington's primarily militarized forms of cooperation with the andean states, but does this conform with their long-term national interests, with their desire to put an end to backwardness and attain a qualitatively new level of socioeconomic development?  after all, a radical solution of the drug problem primarily demands neither combat aircraft not armored personnel carriers, but something quite different.  it is necessary to change the economic profile of vast provinces where the cultivation of coca and marijuana is the sole source of the population's existence.    true enough, the united states has now expressed readiness to assist also in this sphere.  on the other hand, there is an almost total lack of readiness to import from south america the crops which could, in principle, squeeze out coca and marijuana.  it was not for nothing that colombia's president virgilio barco, the white house's closest ally in the struggle against drugs, was forced to declare in cartagena that the u.s. government's rigid protectionist measures are jeopardizing the very future of \"alternative\" sectors of tropical crop farming -- the cultivation of coffee, flowers, and sugar cane.  and so the \"senior partner\" appears to be tightening with the one hand the vise in which the drug mafia now finds itself, while using the other hand to protect its market from legal latin american exports.    finally, the last but, i think, most substantive argument. actually, it also casts an unfavorable light on the role of consistent fighter against the drug mafia which washington has now assumed.  this argument is perfectly encapsulated in just one short word: \"panama.\" indeed, did the recent aggression against this sovereign state, one of whose main motives was actually \"to punish the drug business bosses,\" not demonstrate all the flaws of washington's \"strongarm approach\" toward latin america?  and are there any guarantees that the pentagon will not start \"copying\" its panamanian experience in other countries in the continent on the pretext of pursuing the \"cocaine barons\"?    these are far from rhetorical questions, and it is a pity that cartagena simply failed to provide even the slightest clear-cut answers to them.", "extracts": {"PerpInd": [[["terrorists", 1300]]], "PerpOrg": [], "Target": [[["stores", 1337]], [["marinas", 1355]]], "Victim": [], "Weapon": [[["bombs", 1283]]]}}

(end recording)    only hours after the president made these statements, the u.s. embassy in guatemala issued a communique stating that if the united states abstained from voicing its concern over human rights abuses, it would indeed be acting as an accomplice.  the communique cites statements made on 5 march in washington by state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiller that u.s. ambassador strook, in his capacity as president bush's personal representative, has on many occasions told top guatemalan officials, in public and private, that those who commit violent acts must be turned over to justice.    strook is currently in washington where he was recalled by the state department for consultations.  according to the diplomatic mission, the ambassador's statements accurately reflect the permanent u.s. position of considering human rights as an issue that must be treated at an international level.

(ojeda) general, much has been said about venezuela's alleged vulnerabilty to the international drug trafficking cartels.  is this true? is there a danger that venezuela could become an operational base for the cocaine mafia?  is it true that heavy investments have been detected near the border and other areas of the country, with money of which no one knows the source?  what is being done to control this flow of capital?    (ibedaca) i share this concern.  it is very simple: when you are in a building or a house and there are problems in your neighbor's house, this of course directly affects you because of the unrest, because there might be an uncomfortable situation where for example, you might have to testify.    ibedaca thus begins his explanations with a simple, easy-to-understand domestic analogy.  he admits that venezuela \"is in a situation that should really catch our attention, because venezuela borders colombia and we know that coca is produced mainly in bolivia, peru, ecuador, and is processed in colombia.  colombia is america's great cocaine laboratory.  drug traffickers have recently suffered hard setbacks through recent actions by the colombian army and national police in which the heads of these organizations have been killed and great amounts of money and cocaine and a number of airplanes have been seized.  to transport what is left, they will, of course, have to look for a better place and this is where we have several vulnerabilities.\"    (ojeda) like what?    (ibedaca) the extensive border, the plains near it with clandestine landing strips; the proximity to easy-to-use ports and airports. through the antidrug trafficking services and together with the disip (directorate of intelligence and prevention services) and the metropolitan police, we have a plan and we have taken definite actions to fight it.  aware of this, we have established a system of investment controls in these states near colombia.  we are receiving reports of property registrations, but we need to take more effective measures, because we need greater control and supervision in this area, especially commercial operations.    in 1986, three years after the drug law went into effect, the gn's antidrug division made a record confiscation of 29,698 kilos of marijuana (nearly 30 tons), a figure that dropped significantly in 1988, and increased in 1989.    since it was founded by general german sepulveda sierra, this office has been in charge of coordinating and planning actions that the gn develops against drug trafficking, even though it is limited by the drug law as an adjunct to the tribunals.  in other words, the files must be turned over to the judicial technical police (ptj).    it is currently called the directorate of the services against drug trafficking and is directed by brigadier general ramon guillen davila, who also agreed to talk to el nacional.    (guillen) the fight against drugs has been a job of the gn during all of its existence.  i have been in it since i was a sublieutenant. now it is called the \"modern crime\" and one of the most difficult wars to fight.    (ojeda) precisely because of that war, the big colombian traffickers have proposed to their country's government formulas to achieve peace and retire from the drug business.  are these proposals from the drug cartels sincere?  we asked the general.    (guillen) i think that it is only a strategy to gain time and seek their own solutions.  it is not strange that they are pretending to turn venezuela into an \"operational base.\"  there is democracy and liberty of movement and investment here.  in just san antonio del tachira, there are 76 exchange houses and only one meets the requirements of the law.  when we have pressured the peracal tax registry, we got complaints from a lot of people.  the venezuelan air and highway system is very favorable to them.  neighboring countries connect with europe through venezuela.  a lot of merchandise goes through in transit, and when they seize a shipment, what they say is that the airplane \"came from venezuela.\"  (continued)", "extracts": {"PerpInd": [], "PerpOrg": [], "Target": [], "Victim": [], "Weapon": []}}

(rivas) mr. president, your replies to previous questions have already answered my first question.  i would like to ask you something, however.  now that the dialogue process is about to start, the two sides have apparently hardened their positions.  the fmln commanders have said that, to end the war in el salvador, there must be a solution to the problems of injustice and lack of democracy.  the minister of justice, in turn, said recently that the fmln must return to civilian life and that there is no need to negotiate.  i would like to know what will be negotiated and what will be done to end the war through a dialogue with the fmln.    (cristiani) i am surprised by the remarks that you are attributing to dr. santamaria, because he is very well informed about what has happened so far.  he is very much aware that there is point two of the geneva agreement, which notes that political agreements must be reached in order to put an end to armed confrontation and the violence that is affecting the civilian population.  subsequently, there will be a process for disarmament and demobilization, referred to as the total suspension of hostilities in the agreement.  i believe that it is a matter of reaching agreements.  we, as a government, are involved in this because we see the suffering of the salvadoran people.  we believe that it is not fair for them to live in a climate of violence in which there are so many killed, so much destruction, and so many problems.    as a government, we have always asked: what are the problems barring their returning to civilian life?  they are the only group that has not joined the salvadoran democratic process.  what do they want?  let us see if there is anything reasonable that can be done. the political parties have expressed willingness to consider all that could foster or consolidate the democratic process in our country.  we believe that there will be no problems. i cannot see any hardening by the government.  i believe we have been flexible.  we have said that the government has been immediately accepting as its own any consensus reached by the parties.  in other words, at least your remark on the government is not true.  i repeat, perhaps in the style of the previous question, that we do not want to be biased.  in due time, we will see whether the fmln has or has not been inflexible or hardened or whatever.  it will depend on whether the fmln's proposals are reasonable or not.    (moderator) pablo yacu of (words indistinct).

(cristiani) well, i think the opposition politicians should try to understand that many of the measures, which certainly entail a sacrifice for the various national sectors, are responsibly taken because of the country's economic and social problems.  many people will say it is not necessary to do this or that.  i would only look at what has happened to other countries which, even without the destruction and violence caused by an irregular force, such as the fmln, have experienced much more serious problems than those encountered by el salvador at present.  we would also encounter those problems if we fail to take measures.  nearby is nicaragua, the inflation rate of which has reached 1,700 percent, its foreign debt is enormous, and it is immersed in dramatic problems.  no measures were taken in due time in brazil and argentina, although these measures were painful.  if they are not taken on time, they will be much more painful later, because eventually something will have to be done to check the economic crisis that has been created.  at this time, we are trying to stabilize the economy to start its effective recovery.  it is based on this recovery that we will avoid foreign indebtedness, which for many other countries has been an easy way out and an alternative, when they should have acted responsibly concerning economic problems.

(valladares) german reyes of acan-efe.    (reyes) good evening.  before anything else i think we should apologize to the housewives for having ruined their soap opera. regarding the green battalions you mentioned, mr. president, which are going to be installed in yamales -- where they should have been before the contras entered -- how are the onuca (united nations observer group in central america) officers going to verify that the contra withdrawal from honduran territory?    (callejas) there is no problem.  the yamales camp is inside honduran territory.  there are mechanisms that allow onuca and ciav (international commission for support and verification) forces to control these persons.  once more i would like to refer to the position you are taking: why not see things positively?  instead of saying we had contras here for 10 years, say that now we do not have any.  i think this is the type of optimism we should impress upon the country.  let us not complain about yesterday, instead build on today's reality.  i am very happy to be here at this news conference and to be able to tell my fellow citizens and you that no longer are we to have contras in honduras -- a positive step.  in this regard the green battalions and the armed forces are taking action to administer a territory that only yesterday was relatively out of control of the government.    (valladares) (words indistinct)    (reporter) mr. president, much has been said about these $247 million -- it seems like a large sum -- which tells of the success of your trip to the united states.  this, however, is to be used to pay debts.  do you know of any specific amounts you may be receiving in the future, or is it a question of having to wait there with a little paper bag to then hand it over to (central bank president) don ricardo maduro?  what are the resource forecasts and what definite investment plans are there for these resources?  one must especially take into account the impact this will have on the central bank currency reserves since inflation can be a time bomb.  lastly, i would like to ask you if you.... (changes thought) apparently my colleague regina has an important question before you end the conference with me. thank you, mr. president.    (callejas) no problem.  i would continue this conference all night long, although i do not wish to keep the housewives from their programs.  however, everything has a time frame and our interest is that all reporters here tonight should have the opportunity of taking part in this news conference.  getting back to your question, the total amount of funds available for the armed forces was established this way: the 1989 budget approved by congress was 150 million lempiras.    (reporter) perhaps i did not make myself clear.  i was referring to the funds the government would have available once loans were paid off with these stopgap loans.    (callejas) you are right.  we are talking about the stopgap financing for $247 million.  this stopgap loan opens the path so that friendly countries and bilateral and multilateral financial organizations can resume their loans to the country.  these funds will give us the right to draw on special imf accounts, funds from special world bank programs such as sal-1 and sal-2, or funds that have been withheld from japan and germany.  the total amount of these funds is enough to pay the $247 million stopgap loan in full and still have some cash left over for some of these organizations that may generate funds for the country.  the precise amounts will be given by the central bank president; however, to answer your question, the amount of funds to be received will be no less than the amount being loaned, plus some surpluses from international organizations and friendly countries, which have withheld their loans or donations because of honduras' ineligibility with the imf.

{"docid": "DEV-MUC3-1250", "doctext": "everybody is praising and justifying the argentine condor ii project -- the only one we had -- now that it has officially died, however, a more technical description of the defunct project will reveal the gap left by our flimsy space project.    according to the type of fuel used, missiles are classified as solid, liquid, and cryogenic-fueled missiles.  the solid-fueled missiles carry their fuel (that burns) and the comburent (that supplies the oxygen to trigger the combustion) on a sticky rod, the combustion of which cannot be regulated.  the cake burns completely once the combustion starts.  therefore, solid-fueled missiles are difficult to control although they are much simpler and cheaper. moreover, they put up with rough handling and can be easily fired. the military prefer this type for manufacturing short-range missiles.    the liquid-fueled missiles carry the fuel and the comburent in completely separate tanks.  the two elements meet in a combustion chamber where they ignite after travelling through pipes.  valves make it possible to regulate the power of the engine.  ground personnel are able to stop the engine and restart it in full flight, in short, to control the missile as they wish through radio messages.    the cryogenic-fueled missiles were developed during the 70's and 80's.  they carry hydrogen and liquid gas which are lighter than any other propellant element but which are very expensive to refrigerate and to isolate.  this technology makes it possible to build very fast vehicles because of their power to weight ratio.    they are used to place huge communication satellites in space some 36,000 km above the equator, or to attack a city from the other side of the world.    liquid-fueled missiles represent the technology developed during the 50's and 60's and, to a certain extent, explains soviet leadership in space research.  these old, heavy, cumbersome, and unbreakable missiles do not have fragile equipment and make it possible to place cargo into outer space at a reasonable cost.  on the other hand, the large family of u.s. and european cryogenic- fueled missiles continue at an experimental stage and are unpredictable (as the case of the space shuttle and the ariane iv and v).  moreover, they are incredibly costly.    too poor to even think of developing liquid-fueled missiles, brazil and argentina have tried to place solid-fueled vehicles into orbit for decades.  this is not all that easy because these missiles are really little more than flying rods (canitas voladoras), but the castor, which was developed by argentina in 1978, the sonda iv developed by brazil, and the japanese launching devices developed by isas (a university space research agency) have proved to be reasonably manageable beasts.    the castor represented the phase previous to designing a spaceship and this must be the reason why it mysteriously died in 1978 after a series of incredibly successful tests and after having allowed us to reach an agreement for a \"joint-venture\" with the frg to study the atmosphere.  the absence of mistakes by a debtor country may be fatal.    when argentina once again started to discreetly think about outer space (1982/83), it already had enough knowledge to consider larger projects.  in fact, with its one meter diameter tube, the condor could place a 200 kg cargo in a low polar orbit of only 200 km.    this project would have allowed argentina to have one or more pairs of eyes in space so that could assess its natural resources, predict the water flow of rivers on which hydroelectric dams could be built, determine where it could find oil and uranium, and cheaply stop illegal fishing on the continental platform.  this possibility could not be accepted by some people.    brazil, which is less hard up, is about to progress from the sonda iv to the sonda v and has openly invited us to jointly develop the spaceship.  what will argentina answer?  \"we will\"?  or will it have a chauvinist attitude?  what a pity it did not adopt that attitude now that it is letting the condor project die in its first stage -- it was never tested -- when the pressure is not as great as it has been. worst of it all is that it is not receiving anything in exchange.    very well then, it is accepted, the condor will go no further. what is left?  very little.  should we develop satellites exclusively for space research to discover the secrets of the sun, or study the cosmic explosions of x-rays.  these issues, if unaffected by economic and political factors, do not disturb anybody.  the nasa is quite willing to give us room, free of charge, on their rockets for this type of satellites.  there is no possibility that we will gain either money or space sovereignty.  there is no need to point out that any similarity between this possibility and an independent space research program, such as brazil's, is mere coincidence.    in the 80's argentina allowed its nuclear program, which at that time was the most advanced in the third world, to be hindered.  now it is allowing its wings to be clipped and, with a stupid smile, is yielding every attempt to achieve sovereignty in space.  each attempt to develop technology is labelled arms escalation by those champions of peace, our creditors.    it is quite true, the condor ii may be a missile, as a cargo aircraft may drop bombs and a truck may be equipped with artillery for war.  does this mean that argentina must stop manufacturing all type of vehicles?

(moderator) raul beltran from radio cadena yskl.    (beltran) mr. president, over the past few hours we have learned about the official statement issued by the commanders of the various garrisons and the high command.  since you are the commander in chief of the armed forces, do you support the document that was published, which condemned the statements made by col. sigifredo ochoa perez?    (cristiani) concerning that situation, i have said that several people have made statements, not just one.  there has been public speculation as to what may have happened in the assassinations of the jesuit priests and the other two people and that is not right.  if someone has any information to contribute, and if that someone is really interested in the progress of justice in this country, he should go to the judge to give him the information.  he should not continue to speculate in public, because it confuses people and it obstructs the judicial process.    i would like to mention, for example, that not long ago a delegation of spanish legal experts visited the country and they were pleased to see how the 4th criminal judge was handling the judicial process, as opposed to other reports that have been released in the united states.  however, i believe that no one should speculate in public as to what may have happened.  if someone has information or evidence, he should go to the judge, otherwise there will be confusion.  in that regard, i believe that the armed forces commanders' rejection of col. ochoa's statements is just that.  in many of the statements they wrote -- i did not participate in drafting the statement -- they mentioned that they are willing to support and strengthen the judicial process, but they cannot come out in public with speculation because they would only confuse people.

(cristiani) i can only tell you that, yes, certainly, the government of the republic has the duty of defending the system and the salvadoran democratic institutions, and -- regardless of what may happen, and we hope that will not occur -- if that happens, we will always have to seek alternate resources for the defense of the country's democratic institutions.  a few days ago i listened to statements by some politicians and members of other sectors, who complained because i said: we have the responsibility of defending the democratic institutions, we have to find the resources, and there are other alternatives to get resources for the national defense.  those politicians said it would be disastrous to affect social programs to help the needy.  that is actually what those politicians should think about when they ask for a reduction in aid.  i believe that is something the government cannot neglect.  the government must defend the system from possible attacks -- through violence to reach power -- which has been termed by central american presidents and by many countries throughout the world as illegal.

(cristiani) well, i think that, first of all, the effect of the reduction or cut of aid would be twofold.  on the first hand, i think it would be a negative signal for the fmln and for the objective of trying to find an end to the conflict through the dialogue process that has been started, and that a cut in aid might be analyzed by some of the members, or all the members of the fmln, as meaning a weakening of the government and its defense and that, therefore, their military victory is now closer.  and it would make it a lot more difficult to end the conflict in a short while through a political dialogue.  secondly, obviously the government has the responsibility to defend the institutions, the democratic institutions of the country, and will not stand by with a weakened defense.  therefore, this means reallocating resources that might be used for other types of programs -- social programs, economic, or political programs that the government can have access to, and obviously to reallocate resources for defense purposes. thus, it would have a twofold impact if that was the case.    on the other hand, i think that the judicial process in the case of the jesuit priests is ongoing.  it will be difficult for me (words indistinct) to think that before it has ended, that there is prejudgement on what the results would be.  i think that the judge, as i said earlier, has received at least the visits of many people.  just recently a group of lawyers from spain came in and analyzed the case, and were very pleased with the way the judge was handling the case, according, obviously, to salvadoran law.

(ungo) in my opinion, the fmln communique has aspects that are interesting and others which i think are not valid.  the time and opportunity of that action is ambivalent.  i think it has negative effects, as well as positive effects for them.  there is always the famous vicious circle wherein if the fmln ceases to act militarily, it is bad for the fmln because it shows a sign of weakness.  if it acts militarily it is also bad, because it shows that it does not want peace.  in this sense, i think there is no doubt that it has exhibited a show of force, that its actions have been strictly propaganda-oriented or with propaganda objectives.  it does not cease to create difficult conditions that generate a negative reaction on the other's part, if they want to sit down and try to ease confrontations as much as possible and seek an agreement as much as possible.  i believe, as i told president cristiani on the telephone yesterday when we spoke of other things but touched on this topic, that i uphold the government's thesis.  we have always criticized the fact that when negative things occur, they are invoked to suspend a process which in our opinion should be continuous.  we have always upheld the continuity of the dialogue.  the government criticized the fmln when on two occasions it suspended the dialogue due to terrorist actions on the part of the government or security corps.  the dialogue and negotiation process has suffered as a result of this.  i believe that in this case the government should take its own medicine.  it should maintain the continuity of the process and not use as a pretext the fmln military actions to try to seek ways of conditioning or perturbing a process of dialogue and negotiation, which involves not only the government and the fmln, but the political parties and social forces as well.    (reporter) dr. ungo, in that sense the government had announced through president cristiani that the dialogue would be resumed on 3 may.  subsequently, the un secretary general's envoy announced that it would be the first part of may.  don't you think that too much time is being spent without being able to agree on summit meetings that will permit securing agreements?    (ungo) i have a very positive analysis of how the process is developing in this first phase, judging by the conduct on the part of the government and the fmln.  i think there has been a delay, but i think it is a delay that improves the possibilities and conditions. apparently the times were marked by haste and precipitation for the fmln to present a proposal.  also, there was a very short time for the government to prepare its response and hold a bilateral meeting later. at the same time, it left a very narrow margin of influence to the political parties and social organizations.    president cristiani himself convened the political parties to explain to them what the situation was and how he viewed the role of the parties.  the parties have their own concept of their role and have been working arduously and responsibly.  in two weeks they held four prolonged, high-level meetings, two per week.  we want to do the same thing with the fmln.  i believe that the period of two to three weeks to one month, since the geneva agreement was signed, has been positive.  if we had hurried things up, perhaps the possibility of achieving results would have been affected.  what happens is that all of this gives way to somewhat pessimistic evaluations, because the confidentiality was violated by president cristiani.  i have been told that these things are part of a private, confidential aide-memoire that was agreed to in geneva between the two top leaders of the fmln and the government delegation with un secretary general perez de cuellar's representative.

(rivera) this is an incorrect image.  i would not say that it is easy to overcome all the power elements in a few years.  still, i can say that progress is being made in this field.  the army's command headed by general gramajo morales, the defense minister, greatly assisted the process of democratization.    (slutzky) are the elements that took part in the coups not connected to the extreme right-wing and the death squads which murdered hundreds of citizens in the past few years, under a democratic regime?    (rivera) it is very probable, but we must remember that these elements are a minority, after all.  the officers who were involved in the first coup were pardoned.  the officers who participated in the second coup were brought to trial.  i believe this indicates a positive development.

{"docid": "DEV-MUC3-1297", "doctext": "chilean president patricio aylwin will today report on the first 70 days of his administration and will make important announcements concerning his future plans in a speech to a plenary meeting of the chilean congress that will mark the beginning of special congressional sessions.    aylwin's speech awakens considerable expectation because of recent unpublicized clashes between aylwin's administration and general august pinochet, who has been throwing his weight around as commander in chief of the army, and also because of the growing rightwing opposition to the actions of the democratic administration.    political analysts have pointed out that the presidential speech will coincide with the \"end of a government-opposition honeymoon\" that had marked the initial weeks of the new administration.    the administration's initiatives regarding human rights, tax reform, the democratization of local governments, and other steps aimed at depriving military courts of their powers have worsened the conflict and have made things more difficult for aylwin's administration.    this is happening because, while the rightwing parties are leaning more and more toward pinochet every day and longing for his authoritarian regime, the leftwing parties and even sectors of the coalition of parties for democracy have been criticizing aylwin for alleged \"lukewarm\" approach to the implementation of the democratic changes that he promised during his electoral campaign.    the rightwing has taken due advantage of several unsolved terrorist attacks over the recent weeks to prop up its opposition in congress to bills related to human rights.    however, according to recent opinion polls, aylwin will make his speech amid growing popularity, much higher than the support he obtained at the 14 december elections.    the presidential speech to congress at the legislative palace in valparaiso, 125 km west of santiago, will mark the return to a long-standing democratic tradition that chileans used to enjoy every 21 may.    on this day, the report to congress was yet another reason for popular rejoicing because it coincided with the \"naval glories day\" which is also commemorated on 21 may in memory of the chile's top naval hero arturo prat who died in the naval battle of iquique during the 1879 pacific war.    since congress was closed down during the military regime, general augusto pinochet used to read his state of the nation address on 11 september, the anniversary of the military coup d'etat through which he seized power.    according to political analysts, aylwin's speech may provide the key to the layout of chile's transition in the future.  the manner in which the president will make his report is rather curious because theoretically this report should encompass one year of government, while aylwin has been president for only 70 days during which the administration has been harshly criticized by the rightwing every time the administration had something bad to say about the prior military regime.    general pinochet personally told aylwin that he felt offended by aylwin's labor day celebration speech on 1 may.    during his latest private meeting with the president, pinochet told aylwin that he felt that the \"truth and reconciliation\" commission that aylwin had created to investigate human rights violations during the military regime was a direct attack on the army.    pinochet also told aylwin that by way of \"protest\" against these actions he would not attend the luncheon to which the president had invited all the commanders of the armed forces branches.    according to leaks about this meeting, aylwin told pinochet: \"watch your step, general\" and reminded him that offensive behavior against the president could harm pinochet's image even within his own institution, the army.    pinochet did not attend the luncheon, however, sending instead general hugo salas, the third highest-ranking army officer and the former chief of the cni (national information center), the secret police of his regime.    pinochet failed in his attempt to convoke the national security council and to make this council issue a statement against the \"truth and reconciliation\" commission, but pinochet's sortie in the political arena awoke concern laced with fear, as one government official admitted to efe.  the source, who asked to remain anonymous, added that \"pinochet is aware of the fear he awakens and he uses it adroitly.\"    the former president will not attend the today's ceremony in congress although the commanders of the other armed forces branches, the very same ones that did not support his attempt to convoke the national security council, will be present.    pinochet claimed that he has \"institutional reasons\" for his absence and has left for northern chile where he is currently touring army garrisons.    analysts believe that the \"pinochet effect\" will be noticeable in aylwin's speech through greater moderation in announcements of new institutional changes and through more benign assessments of the previous military regime.", "extracts": {"PerpInd": [], "PerpOrg": [], "Target": [], "Victim": [], "Weapon": []}}
