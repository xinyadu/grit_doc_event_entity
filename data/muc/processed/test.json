(reporter) (words indistinct) commander, when do you expect the fmln to join the process?    (handal) look, deadlines are not the most important thing right now. what is important now is complying with the agreements to reach political agreements.  that is the main aspect of the geneva agreement.  it is possible that some deadlines will not be met. if deadlines are set and the time for implementing them expires, then this is tantamount to wasting time.  this then leads to steps being demanded that in reality depend on the political agreements that are reached and not the deadlines for reaching them.    therefore, according to the agenda and the timetable agreed to here in caracas, the accent is on the political agreements.  those agreements have to do with changes within the armed forces. everything related to the armed forces must be changed.  every factor concerning the armed forces must be reviewed from a certain point or perspective.  changes are necessary; changes must be made and those changes must be significant. these changes must completely transform the armed forces, beginning with its role and influence in determining the country's policies and guidelines.    we have been presenting proposals in this regard for some time. the topic of democratization is closely linked to the topic of the armed forces, to its purging, its reduction, and in sum, its end.  we believe that the country will not always need the armed forces.  as with any institution or historical factor, it emerges, it is maintained for a certain time, and then it tends to disappear.    the country must have the opportunity to develop. it cannot continue along the same path because this would only represent expenses and a heavy burden for the country.    for several decades, the armed forces have meant absence of liberty, real security, and the impossibility of the civilian society to decide the country's path.  elections have been turned into a mere formality, where those who were not elected run the country.    the country is now going through a drama that has also shocked the international public, the murder of the jesuit priests.  everyone is awaiting the results of the investigations and hoping that those who were responsible for this crime will be punished.  we believe that the case of jesuit priests is really grave; it is a drama that reflects the drama of the salvadoran people's history in the current century.

these are a truer and more accurate reflection of a firm's income.\"    cristiani says that the country's monetary policy must be aimed at increasing savings to promote domestic economic development.  he says that it is necessary to make interest received on savings accounts in the country's banks more attractive so that capital does not leave the country. regarding the country's currency, cristiani says:  \"we feel that currency value should be based on the availability of and demand for foreign exchange.  we do not think it is appropriate for the government to arbitrarily devalue and fix an exchange rate on the salvadoran colon. everything must be based on the foreign exchange our country may have to pay out for imports, because if we were to fix the rate at 10 (colones) to 1 (dollar), the central banks still would not have enough foreign exchange to cover all the importers' demands.\"    further details as available.", "extracts": {"PerpInd": [], "PerpOrg": [], "Target": [], "Victim": [], "Weapon": []}}
{"docid": "TST3-MUC4-0026", "doctext": "1. during the years of dictatorship, chilean foreign relations were divided into two processes. on the one hand, as the dictatorship became more and more isolated, it was increasingly condemned in international fora and repudiated by international public opinion. on the other hand, as more and more countries and organizations expressed their support for a free chile and generously granted their solidarity to our cause, our organizations and democratic parties became increasingly open to the world. thus, they expanded their horizons and contributed their experiences.    2. during this period, the party has substantially strengthened its international relations and enhanced its vision of the international situation. it has strengthened its ties with the latin american peoples' revolutionary and democratic cause, and it has fully immersed itself in the great debates of world socialism. to these debates we brought our views on a profoundly renewed leftist socialism committed to democracy, development, and social change.    3. our relations with the parties that make up the international socialist (si) and with the si organization itself have been enriched within this context. this strengthening of ties has been the result of two things. first, it is based on the position that in compliance with its principles the si has upheld regarding the chilean situation. in october 1973, a few days after the coup, si chairman willy brandt condemned the end of the chilean democracy and president allende's assassination at the un general assembly. at the time he also said this was a great step backward for those who aspired to achieve socialism through democratic means. since then, the si has been permanently mobilized in favor of chile by making the chilean cause and salvador allende the symbols of all international struggle for democracy and change. it is within this framework of interest and cooperation that the voice of chilean socialism has been heard and our ideas and proposals praised.    4. the second reason stems from the process of expansion and transformation experienced by the si in the past 2 decades. the overall process of change that took place in the world during this period -- the technological revolution, the growing interdependence among nations, expansion of communications, global nuclear and military proliferation, the emergence of developing countries as international counterparts, the worsening of extreme poverty and international inequalities, the progress of liberation struggles in the third world, international awareness of the values of democracy and human rights -- has also effected major changes in the ideas and positions of socialist parties around the world. in this framework, the si has expanded its outlook, has increasingly renewed its ideas and, above all, has accepted pluralism within its fold as well as a broad internal debate about the best way to promote the cause of an autonomous, democratic socialism. it should be noted that this debate acquired a democratic, antifascist content as a result of the major role played by socialist forces that have engaged in a long antifascist struggle.

{"docid": "TST3-MUC4-0047", "doctext": "the most pressing demands of the chilean people have been brought up in the electoral campaign.  one of the most important achievements of this campaign has been the combining of the campaign with the just economic, political, and social demands that the democratic forces and the popular movement have been making for these 16 years of dictatorship.  these demands are related to the struggle against repression, the defense of human rights, the denunciation of crimes committed by the regime, and efforts to fight immunity and the suppression of the truth regarding torture, disappearances, and assassinations. these questions have once again come into the spotlight now that many rightist candidates are demagogically attempting to pose as defenders of human rights and since el mercurio has reported that the dictator is planning to convert the cni (national information center) into an agency of the army so that the main repressive body from all these years can be under his direct control.  jaime inzunza, leader of the united left and the communist party of chile, discusses these topics over a direct phone line from santiago, chile.    (begin recording) (announcer) how are the chilean people's demands connected to the ongoing electoral campaign?    (inzunza) they are connected through the democratization of the neighborhood boards during the electoral process; the strengthening of the unified actions of workers; the development of the committees for victory, which will also be committees for the defense of victory and committees for carrying on the democratic task; the development of confidence; the struggle for human rights, particularly concerning truth and justice and immunity for crimes; the increasing pressure by the immense majority of the population for the release of all political prisoners; and naturally for the dissolution of the cni. all of these questions are being brought up in the electoral campaign, and agreements have been reached within social organizations.  this was evidenced a week ago by the salvadora strike and by the current strike by coal miners.  this proves that the people have understood that the electoral campaign has to be an expression of their activities and a way to strengthen their social organizations for the future struggle. (end recording)    the preceding comments were made by communist party of chile leader jaime inzunza, who has been interviewed over the telephone on our program \"escucha chile.\"  another topic discussed by inzunza was the el mercurio report on the cni's transfer to the army.  the dissolution of the cni has become one of the most pressing demands of the immense majority of chileans.    (begin recording) (announcer) what is your opinion, jaime inzunza, on the dictator's intention to maintain the cni as it is and to keep it under his direct command?    (inzunza) i believe that this issue is particularly serious.  the intention is to maintain intact the main terrorist apparatus of the dictatorship, which has been responsible for the most flagrant violations of human rights throughout the years of its existence.  i understand that the dina (national intelligence directorate, replaced by cni) and the cni have been in fact a single apparatus and therefore the main organs of state terrorrism over the past 15 years.  if transferred to the army, the cni would continue to be under pinochet's orders.  under whose orders has it been all these years?  for whom has it been a direct agent all these years?  henceforth it will be under the control of the office of the commander in chief of the army. (end recording)    communist leader jaime inzunza added that pinochet's intent in transferring the cni to the army's direct command is to make the institution an accomplice in concealing people who have been responsible for crimes and human rights violations.    (begin recording) (inzunza) the idea is to involve the military institution in crimes for which the chilean people knows it was not responsible.  this is clear: what the democratic opposition forces want is to have the culprits behind those crimes and human rights violations prosecuted, not the military institution.  the transfer of the cni to the army is an attempt to make the men in uniform act as accomplices or accessories to those crimes.  loyalty is not at stake here; loyalty is defending values and principles, not some sort of criminal complicity that is not in line with the training of these men.  this seems to me to be particularly serious because this transfer implies maintaining the cni under the orders of the man responsible for the crimes committed all these years, the dictator himself.

(cristiani) as i have said before, statements by ortega and other representatives of the sandinist front are a source of concern.  they could indicate that the elections may have been very free and honest, but also a farce as far as improving the democratic process is concerned.  the nicaraguan people would be denied the right to freely pick their rulers and the right of these rulers to act as they deem best.  i would say that the nicaraguan revolution belongs not just to the fsln.  the fsln was one of the participants in the revolution in nicaragua against anastasio somoza.  the fact is that a consensus existed among all sectors that supported that revolution.  the fsln has no monopoly on or exclusive control over that revolution.    i believe that in ideological terms there are differences between the views of ms. chamorro and uno (national opposition union), that is, the new government-elect, and the views of the fsln.  yet, the people picked the government.  it is worrisome to hear some statements that the fsln will rule from below.  we believe they would seek to do that by keeping control over the army.  let me repeat: there is nothing democratic about a political party controlling the army.  the army must respond to the government and the country's democratic process, and not to just one political party.  we believe things have not been settled yet.  we believe that there are still many things left pending.

to intensify and spread the repudiation of noriega's collaborators by mentioning specific names; to convince noriega that he had lost fdp support and that his regime was unsustainable; to convince noriega's panamanian collaborators that he had lost fdp support and that his regime was unsustainable; to convince foreign governments and noriega allies, particularly cuba and nicaragua, that he had lost fdp support and that his government was unsustainable; to convince governments that were hostile to noriega, especially venezuela and colombia, that he had lost fdp support and that his regime was unsustainable; to convince foreign revolutionary movements that dealt with noriega, such as the fmln and the m-19, that he had lost fdp support and that his regime was unsustainable; and to move the anti-noriega sector within the fdp to support specific actions against noriega's regime.    the fdp members, officers, and troops were the targets of this plan.  we see how some were taken in by the psychological operations plan.  the targets of this plan were gen noriega, noriega's panamanian collaborators within the fdp, some civilians, foreign governments that are noriega's allies, foreign governments that are hostile to noriega, and foreign revolutionary organizations that deal with noriega. they identified all of noriega's vulnerabilities, as well as the vulnerabilities of all the targets we have already mentioned.    there were certain themes used in these psychological operations, and the media fell for them many times. this is why we repeatedly asked them not to fall for this misinformation.    these themes included: by imposing his arbitrary nature and corruption, noriega is perverting the fdp and promoting the disintegration of that military institution.  the fdp have become a mafia that is heading toward disgrace. this is a topic that has been discussed in leaflets and many publications.    by disrupting the constitutional order at his whim, noriega is provoking a profound social, economic, and political crisis that is ruining the country. this is done to hide those who are truly responsible for the crisis we are experiencing. the longer noriega remains in power, the more probable becomes a u.s., cuban, or soviet intervention.  the domestic and international conflicts provoked by noriega negatively affect the personal well-being of the fdp members and their families.    noriega's fall is inevitable and the fdp should not fall with him. to save the fdp and the republic of panama, the fdp must remove noriega from office. this is why there were siren songs that an internal coup was under way.    the state security organizations have been following this case for 5 months and we know the fugitives are in the united states. we know where they left from. no one can deny the association of certain u.s. citizens who are involved in this operation with the panamanian groups that were captured.    we have the evidence, the weapons, the instruments used for misinformation, the plans, and the maps with the targets for violence. important people who were going to be kidnapped had also been marked on these maps. they had marked the bridges that were to be destroyed.    gentlemen, we know the power of weapons and we know how to use them.  we know the damage they can do. therefore, before there was a violent confrontation between the panamanian people and their fdp, we went one step ahead of their plans. if arrests were made, it was because we wanted to avoid a confrontation with inexperienced groups that allowed themselves to be used for the personal benefit of those who received, with a siren song, the promise of the panamanian people's $30 million that eric arturo delvalle was going to use for subversive acts, bloody acts to bathe our people in blood, as in the case of the struggle of our brother countries in latin and central america.    we will not permit that. that is why we decided to go one step ahead and foil these plans that have a certain purpose and that would result in mourning and pain for panamanian families.    we have the evidence and those who were arrested were damn well arrested: alberto conte, fred boyd, and all those people who have been working behind the scenes so eduardo herrera and friends can live like kings in the united statets, so they can live their lives drinking champagne and eating pheasant.    eduardo herrera was dismissed from a diplomatic post for smuggling 40 boxes of whiskey per week into israel.  he is the kind of person protected by the pentagon and elliott abrams. he is elliott abrams' hero.    theresa wellington of the (u.s.) embassy in mexico, who gave these people--who left panama for mexico-- their visas in 10 minutes by abrams' orders, has also become one of our people's enemies.
