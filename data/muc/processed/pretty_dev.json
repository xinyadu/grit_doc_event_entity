    "doctext": "the guatemala army denied today that guerrillas attacked the \"santo tomas\" presidential farm, located on the pacific side, where president cerezo has been staying since 2 february.    a report published by the \"cerigua\" news agency -- mouthpiece of the guatemalan national revolutionary unity (urng) -- whose main offices are in mexico, says that a guerrilla column attacked the farm 2 days ago.    however, armed forces spokesman colonel luis arturo isaacs said that the attack, which resulted in the death of a civilian who was passing by at the time of the skirmish, was not against the farm, and that president cerezo is safe and sound.    he added that on 3 february president cerezo met with the diplomatic corps accredited in guatemala.    the government also issued a communique describing the rebel report as \"false and incorrect,\" and stressing that the president was never in danger.    col isaacs said that the guerrillas attacked the \"la eminencia\" farm located near the \"santo tomas\" farm, where they burned the facilities and stole food.    a military patrol clashed with a rebel column and inflicted three casualties, which were taken away by the guerrillas who fled to the mountains, isaacs noted.    he also reported that guerrillas killed a peasant in the city of flores, in the northern el peten department, and burned a tank truck.",

(words indistinct) so as for the compensation subject, it will be used.  we are using the mechanism created by the five-member commission established by the treaty. the language of this treaty was pertinent for the early decades of this century but is no longer in keeping with current international practices.  (end recording)    during the news conference with argentine and foreign journalists, vargas carreno also announced that president carlos menem will visit chile in august in response to an invitation from chilean president patricio aylwin, who will also visit argentina at an as yet undetermined date.    vargas carreno noted his satisfaction with his meetings in buenos aires with foreign minister domingo cavallo and raul carignano, under secretary for latin american affairs.  vargas carreno said that as a result of this initial contact the binational commission established by the chilean-argentine peace and friendship treaty, which was signed in 1984, will meet next july.  he said that the two countries will continue to hold formal and informal talks to discuss problems of common interest, speed up the integration process, and increase mutual understanding and cooperation.    regarding the situation of hundreds of thousands of chilean citizens living in argentina -- a total he estimated at 800,000 -- vargas carreno said that president aylwin's government has established an office to help those citizens living abroad for various reasons to return to chile, especially those living in argentina's patagonia region who are being treated inhumanely, especially by businessmen in the border area, as reported by an argentine journalist.",

    "doctext": "the executive branch has called a special session of congress for tomorrow and the next day to consider the serious situation of panama and to denounce the inter-american reciprocal assistance treaty, tiar, for its ineffectiveness.  this was announced by president alan garcia at the conclusion of a council of ministers meeting at government house today.  the president also expressed his surprise over the mildness with which the rest of the latin american countries have reacted to the u.s. aggression against panama.  president garcia also said that the fuel price increase will allow petroperu (state petroleum agency) to operate.    (begin recording) (unidentified reporter) what important subjects were discussed in the council of ministers meeting today?    (garcia) the main subject was the decision to call a special congressional session on 22 and 23 december to consider the serious situation created by the u.s. invasion in panama.  the second important subject was the decision to denounce the tiar, a military organization that groups all the latin american countries and the united states and which, on several occasions, has proved to be absolutely ineffective and partial.    the malvinas islands situation is a good example.  according to the tiar, the united states should have supported argentina, but it did exactly the contrary, supporting the united kingdom.    now, in this case with panama, the tiar has not served any purpose. rather, it has served to mask the u.s. invasion of panama.  therefore, since we consider the tiar to be ineffective and senseless, we, as a republic, must denounce it.  we must withdraw our signature from the tiar.  this must be done through congress, and that is why we have called a special session.    (reporter) several sectors have described the decision to withdraw the peruvian ambassador to the united states as a hasty decision. what do you think of that?    (garcia) i think that those must be sectors committed to the invasion.  they must support a rightist concept by which the united states has the hegemonic right to safeguard our destiny and to decide who can govern us and who cannot.    as peruvians and latin americans, we feel that the aggressive and bloody action by u.s. troops to occupy a small country is a violation. there are currently nearly 30,000 u.s. soldiers in panamanian territory.  they have killed many people and they want to impose a new government.  thus, as long as those troops remain there, as long as this violation to latin america is maintained, our ambassador will not stay in that country.  this does not imply a break in relations; it represents a clear gesture of condemnation and dislike.    as long as a u.s. soldier violates the republic of panama, we will keep our ambassador here.  as long as the united states does not withdraw their troops and panama remains occupied, the panamanian and peruvian flags will remain together.    (reporter) don't you think that this attitude could harm certain relations with the united states; that is, couldn't it jeopardize the imf loan?    (garcia) not at all.  these are two absolutely different things. the negotiations with the imf are one thing; the international political attitude of a government that abuses its economic and military power with other countries is something else.    besides, we should mention something very important.  as for panamanian-u.s. relations, the americans have been the main accomplices in depriving panama of democracy.  when elections took place in 1984, when arnulfo arias should have won, the united states decided that it was not convenient that arias should win, so a large fraud -- as it was declared at the time -- was carried out to place nicolas ardito barletta in power.  the first ones to recognize ardito were the americans.  ardito was placed in the presidency by noriega.    in 1985 noriega removed ardito and put eric arturo del valle in his place.  the americans immediately recognized del valle as president. therefore, the united states has been noriega's accomplice in depriving panama of democracy.  we denounced this.  noriega is a creation of the united states.  it has repeatedly been said that noriega worked with the united states and with the u.s.  central intelligence agency, where president bush was once chief.    therefore, now that the maid is answering back, making claims to the panama canal and wanting to become independent from the united states, the united states suddenly discovers that she is a drug trafficker and that she does not serve its interests, so they send 30,000 u.s. soldiers to panama.  this is an abuse.  it is a violation of the sovereignty of another state.    no honorable latin american country should tolerate this invasion without actively and openly condemning it.  one way to condemn it and express disapproval of it is to say that as long as the troops invading latin america remain, we do not need to maintain our ambassador there.

    "doctext": "after nearly a 2-month absence from the national press, major roberto d'aubuisson holds the view that the armed forces should not be criticized for the isolated behavior of some of its members.  the arena (nationalist republican alliance) leader is of the opinion that the armed forces themselves were the ones that exerted pressure so that the jesuits' murder case could be cleared-up.    (begin recording) (d'aubuisson) it was not the institution (armed forces) that was involved in the problem.  regrettably some of its members did it and now the entire armed forces are under pressure for political reasons.  however, we must realize that it is thanks to the armed forces that we have this democratic process, with a hope that our country develops and recovers.  it is very unfair that some people pass judgment or criticize without really knowing how hard it has been on all the officers, noncommissioned officers, and troops who have had to put up with these attacks in addition to the intense work they have had for the past few months. (end recording)    d'aubuisson said that once the murder of the six jesuits has been cleared up, u.s. authorities have no reason to question the continuation of u.s. economic assistance to the country.    (begin recording) (d'aubuisson) the jesuits' case was a determining factor.  but now that the case has been fully solved with the help of the fbi, scotland yard, and investigators from other countries, this is no longer a problem, although previously it was serious.  i do not believe there can be any doubt now about receiving the aid, especially after the tremendous offensive launched by the fmln (farabundo marti national liberation front).  for argument's sake, if the situation did arise (whereby aid was suspended), this would only favor the fmln.  i know the fmln has a whole range of support groups that handle disinformation and make it appear as if things here were disastrous. for example, information abroad is that the air force leveled all the neighborhoods.  we salvadorans know that the air force was excessively cautious and did an excellent job repelling this attack with a minimum of civilians wounded.  for that matter, if we are going to compare things, u.s. military operations in panama were more clumsy -- there they set a whole neighborhood on fire. (end recording)    the arena leader also denied that there were differences between president cristiani and himself.  according to international press agencies, the decision of the salvadoran president to prosecute the military men involved in the jesuits' murder caused division within the party.  d'aubuisson denied this was true.    (begin recording) (d'aubuisson) not in the least.  there have never been any differences with president cristiani.  on the contrary, we are very close and grateful for the great effort, work, and the magnificent job president cristiani is doing.  this is reason for pride not only among friends of president cristiani but for the party and friends of the salvadoran government. (end recording)    in commenting on the dialogue with the fmln, d'aubuisson supported president critiani's initiative of engaging the assistance of the un secretary general.    (begin recording) (d'aubuisson) i do not think he has the time to act as mediator; however, he could act as a guarantor, receiving results of these talks and ensuring compliance with the commitments made. (end recording)    maj roberto d'aubuisson, currently an arena deputy, said that this year he will dedicate his time to expand and reorganize the party to get ready for the 1991 municipal and parliamentary elections.  he will most likely not be an arena deputy in the next legislative period, because he, along with other former legislators, will concentrate their political activities on the central american parliament.",

    "doctext": "on 30 november when u.s.  president bush set forth to malta to meet with soviet leader gorbachev, a report from angola said that a central intelligence agency (cia) airplane on a clandestine mission of delivering weapons to the antigovernment national union for the total independence of angola (unita) crashed in southern angola on 27 november and that the four americans on the plane were killed.  today both the u.s. state department and the defense department confirmed the crash, but they refused to comment on whether the americans who were killed were cia officials, or on the nature of the plane's mission.  this is in sharp contrast to the response that the u.s. government made a few days ago in connection with a plane crash in el salvador.    after a plane carrying weapons to the salvadoran guerrillas crashed on 25 november, u.s. secretary of state baker promptly instructed the undersecretary of state on that same evening to summon the soviet ambassador to the united states to protest to the soviet union for undermining peace in central america and \"failing to exercise its influence\" to stop cuba and nicaragua from delivering weapons to the guerrillas in el salvador.  in this connection, a u.s.  government official pointed out that president bush would present the central america issue as an important issue while discussing problems of regional conflicts with soviet leaders during their mediterranean meeting.  some officials even said that the central america issue is the \"principal obstacle\" to the improvement of u.s.-soviet relations, and that only when the ussr makes further concessions on the central america issue will it be possible for the united states to provide economic assistance to the soviet union.    in a ceasefire accord signed on 24 june this year, unita and the angolan government agreed to seek ways and means to conclude the civil war that had gone on for 14 years.  however, the u.s.  government keeps supplying weapons to unita.  according to u.s.  newspapers, ever since the south african authorities stopped supplying weapons to unita last april, the united states has become unita's main weapon supplier. the secret that the united states' military assistance to unita increased from $15 million to $50 million this year was revealed after the crash of the cia's weapon carrier.  now, even the u.s. press has asked this question: could it prevent president bush from presenting his criticism when problems of regional conflicts are discussed when he meets the soviet leader?  a u.s. state department official said: \"not at all,\" \"we will not place (the two) on a par.\"  a state department official also said that the u.s. government will continue to provide \"appropriate and effective assistance\" to unita in the future.",

    "doctext": "as a latin american president, i feel a little bit uncomfortable over the statement that the north americans are victims of the drugs produced in latin america and that colombia, peru, and bolivia are to blame for producing the drugs; let's call those countries to talk with them. that seems to me a very ethnocentric vision; it looks at this matter from only one side.  our peasants are poor people who produce whatever is most profitable, and coca cultivation happens to be most profitable for them.  this is so, speaking coldly, honestly, and sincerely.  as president of peru i have to point out that my people, the huallage region peasants, cannot be considered as criminals or as people who must be jailed for producing coca leaves.    we have exchanged these views with president barco, and we reached these conclusions.  we must also note that this matter has been handled with a great deal of publicity. after the death of carlos galan, a great colombian leader, the colombian government launched an offensive intended to find out whether the drug trafficking bands were responsible for his assassination, and the u.s. government then extended some assistance.  this assistance has been present to the world as though the united states had sent an enormous quantity of aircraft, hundreds of helicopters, and thousands of millions of dollars to colombia.  as i was able to see in bogota, only helicopters, some of which had been purchased earlier by the colombian government, were sent.  i was also informed that some of those helicopters had been used previously in peru.    i have said that, if there is that much conviction, i support president bush for defending u.s. society.  if he has that much conviction, it is hard to believe that less than one thousandth of what is spent in arms and military expenditures should be allocated to replace coca plantations and to improve the general situation in latin america.  we have talked with president barco, and i will talk with president paz zamora to see how we can exchange opinions.  then, as president bush said, a meeting of presidents will be welcome.  but the meeting should also be attended by europe, which has a fundamental interest in the future.    (correspondent) would the idea be to hold a meeting in the near future of peru, colombia, and bolivia with president bush and a representative of the eec?    (garcia) yes, because drug trafficking is a growing problem. cartels have sprouted in colombia -- monopolies that try to elect deputies and senators to influence the government.  those monopolies might extend their operations to our countries if we do not stop this growing problem. the situation can become worse in bolivia, where it was said that the drug traffickers had an influence on a dictatorial military regime.  it is not just a matter of protecting the morality of humanity; it is not just a matter of defending the united states, which has a primary role in world leadership; it is essentially a matter of defending our democracy -- the legitimacy and cleanliness of our social life.  i hope that we can have a meeting of the three presidents first, so that we can let the u.s.  president know our views on the overall problem.    (correspondent) will you propose that meeting, mr president?    (garcia) i don't want to assume a leading role.  the idea emerged in a conversation with president barco, and i will talk later with president paz zamora.    (correspondent) a meeting between you and president bush late this month has been mentioned.  is this true, mr president?    (garcia) no, i believe that has been mere speculation in the press. for the time being i have discarded the idea of making another trip abroad.  i do not see the concrete possibility of meeting with president bush, although i hope we can meet sometime before 28 july 1990.    (correspondent) changing the subject, mr president -- much has been said in recent days about the possible or probable expulsion of peru from the imf.  what is the truth about this, and what would expulsion mean?    (garcia) well, first, it is politically impossible for peru to be expelled from the imf.  second, there is misinformation and alarmism regarding the matter.  what is the imf?  it is some sort of creditor bank created in 1946 that lends money to countries with balance-of-payments problems; that is, with problems with their foreign reserves levels.  when a country has no reserves or only $100 million in reserves, it can apply for a credit from the imf to pay for imports or overdue debts.  this is the imf, an organization created to facilitate the flow of international financial resources.  an imf credit is dependent on signing a letter of intent or an adjustment program.  adjustment means reducing the country's internal consumption so as to spare the country's reserves in order to meet debt obligations.

    "doctext": "next june an entire u.s. army company will carry out joint maneuvers with argentine troops in a province of the littoral region.  the maneuvers, designed to teach the argentine officers the latest techniques against drug trafficking, fall within the comprehensive military exchange plan.  general maxwell thurman's visit is also part of the aforementioned plan.    according to reliable sources, the recent visit from the united states of 10 lieutenant colonels, three colonels, and eight civilian experts in defense strategy, represent an important step in the renewed u.s.-argentine military relationship.    the same sources have stated that the gradual and restricted participation of the army in maneuvers designed to practice fighting against drug trafficking has been authorized by the defense ministry and even by the president.    the military group that arrived in argentina on 6 may carried out war games at the war school and the campo de mayo military school and, later on, carried out field maneuvers. other forces participated in the three-day maneuvers that were carried out on an island in the river plate delta. according to a witness, the maneuvers consisted of \"raids\" including \"surprise\" situations that forced the u.s. troops to endure bad weather and bad terrain.    according to the final evaluation, the maneuvers were regarded as \"satisfactory and successful\".  according to the program, a complete u.s. company that will train with argentine troops in a province of the littoral region is scheduled to arrive in june.    foreign ministry sources confirmed the existence of exchange plans but stated that general thurman had proposed to the chiefs of staff the possibility of carrying out joint maneuvers to fight drug trafficking during a luncheon.    the sources stated that the chiefs of staff have made some objections to the proposal and did not reach any agreement. however, sources that participated in the recent maneuvers on the island had a different opinion and ratified that another maneuver would be held in a province of the littoral in june.    anyhow, the statement of the foreign ministry spokesman falls within the diplomatic policy that may partly differ with the military and defense policies, as was pointed out by a sector of the media yesterday.    moreover, general thurman will remain in san carlos de bariloche until saturday, 19 may, and that same day will fly to the iguazu falls from where he will return to his military base in panama.    the only purpose of general thurman's visit was to offer the defense ministry all the technology, know how, and weapons for the struggle against drug trafficking which, in many cases turns into narcoterrorism, in other words, the use of drug trafficking to finance the purchase of weapons and terrorist actions. thurman's visit, which took the united states a whole year to arrange, was previously approved by the u.s. senate.    within the same framework, the bolivian police have just received weapons and other equipment amounting to $50 million, which is enough to equip two complete battalions in charge of fighting drug traffickers.    therefore, the argentine government's decision to contribute to the struggle against drug trafficking launched by the united states is part of a comprehensive strategy of the southern cone of which argentina -- according to experts -- must participate out of fear of a growing isolation.    it is quite likely that the restricted and gradual -- by no means massive -- participation of the army and probably the navy in maneuvers for the struggle against drug trafficking may be the key that will finally allow the armed forces to acquire the war materiel, spare parts and other elements it needs.    the analysts have recalled that the u.s. government's determination to fight corruption -- a problem that also worries president carlos menem and vice president eduardo duhalde -- falls within the same framework because, in the experts' opinion, it is the equivalent to drug trafficking.    highly reliable sources have recalled that 30 days ago president george bush sent president menem two volumes of a u.s. edition on techniques to fight corruption.",

(begin recording) (gonzalez) the peace process between m-19 and the national government was seriously jeopardized this week due to the murder of two members of that guerrilla organization, which occurred at the border between cauca and valle del cauca departments.  carlos pizarro leongomez expressed his concern over the situation.

(gonzalez) over the past few hours, presidential peace adviser rafael pardo and deputy government minister jose noe rios met with members of the m-19 command.  the participants reaffirmed their determination to continue with the peace efforts.    a forum for life, democracy, and progress will be held in santo domingo this weekend, with the participation of political leaders and representatives from grassroots organizations.  the event will include sports and cultural activities.  commissions will work on development plans.  at least 2,000 people are expected this weekend at the peace camp.",

    "doctext": "today salvadoran president alfredo cristiani rejected a rebel proposal to immediately negotiate a cease-fire with the army under oas and united nations supervision; however, he did express his intention to seek a political solution to the armed conflict in the country.    the salvadoran air force attacked the outskirts of san salvador with machinegun fire and rockets just as president cristiani rejected the dialogue proposal made by the guerrillas on 22 november.    four \"push and pull\" planes and two helicopter gunships opened fire on alleged farabundo marti national liberation front (fmln) columns in northern san salvador.    \"their proposal is not serious, (the rebels) are once again saying that there are two armed forces.  in el salvador there is only one armed force,\" cristiani said.  he added that a political solution entails that the guerrillas end the violence.    the president, accompanied by colonel rene emilio ponce, chief of staff of the armed forces, said in a news conference that the fmln proposal \"is not very serious\" because \"it is not aimed at the government but at the army, which is part of the government,\" he said.    according to cristiani, the new fmln proposal is \"propagandist\" and is only meant to gain some time in view of the \"military defeat suffered in the last few days.\"    cristiani said that the government is willing to seek a rational solution to the military conflict in this country, but he categorically emphasized that this means that the guerrillas must lay down their weapons and join the democratic process.    \"we will not allow the guerrillas to regroup and begin attacking again.  if they want to hold a dialogue, they should lay down their weapons and peacefully join the democratic process,\" cristiani said.    the president warned that \"the government and the armed forces are willing to fight militarily. it all depends on whether the fmln continues to behave this way, not listening to reason, and not ending this madness,\" the rightist president said.    the news conference, held with some 50 journalists, was abruptly interrupted by the heavy bombings carried out by the salvadoran air force against alleged guerrilla columns.    following the first bombings, which rocked the military offices where the news conference was being held, cristiani and ponce resumed control of the conference and explained that the attack was the result of an operation in pursuit of the \"guerrillas fleeing in disarray.\"    the air force bombing began shortly before the curfew, which began at 1800 (0000 gmt) until 0600 in the morning (1200 gmt), just when thousands of salvadorans were returning home.    the heavy explosions caused alarm among the population in northern san salvador and it is unknown whether civilians have been hurt.    according to cristiani, the guerrilla offensive \"has been a failure\" not only militarily, but politically as well because they were unable to incite the people to rebellion, as they planned.    the proposal signed by the top five fmln commanders and read on the official rebel station, clandestine radio venceremos, has been released in the framework of a rebel military offensive, which began 12 days ago and which has left more than 1,000 people dead, hundreds of people wounded, and tens of thousands of people homeless.",

(begin recording) (reporter) good morning, colonel.    (ochoa) good morning. thanks, raul.  these gentlemen seem to be speaking in the name of the entire armed forces.  i know well what was discussed in the meeting. someone even said that the bright idea of discharging me was considered.  they failed to take into account, however, that i am a deputy and that, as a deputy and a citizen, i am entitled to express what i feel, just as i have done.  i, who owe everything to the armed forces, who fought beside the soldiers as monterrosa, carlitos, and very few others did, never got rich when in the armed forces, as some of the commanders did, although not all of them, of course.  this undoubtedly has irritated them.    i have simply expressed my viewpoint as a soldier concerned about the armed forces' situation.  i never mentioned any names.  i simply demanded justice because, even according to military theory, i cannot conceive that such an important decision could have been made by a single person.  i still think this is a plot by some members of the institution, not by the armed forces as such.  i only have respect and love for the armed forces.  i am concerned over the delicate situation to which the institution could be led because of the actions of some nefarious members.  i have deep respect for the officers in the field, who fight every day.  of course, i must criticize those who have profited from the institution and who today have raised the roof, as if i were the one to blame and as if i were undermining the institutionality of the state.  quite the opposite is true.  my criticism is positive and intends to encourage a deeper investigation and exhaust all resources in this direction.  i would like them to stop making ridiculous demands and to stop seeking a confrontation. it is known that what i am demanding is what is being felt and said. i am not accusing anyone in particular.  i am only demanding justice. commanders' meetings should not be held to make such a statement. they should have instead shown their concern over the armed forces' situation.  i would have been very interested in seeing them take the stand to continue the investigation to the last consequences.  as the military man i am, i only assessed the situation.  i never mentioned any names, but insisted that a deeper inquiry should be made to carry out justice, because otherwise it is the institution that will suffer.    (reporter) col ochoa, after the \"sixty minutes\" program on cbs in the united states, it seems that in this capital and in the country your remarks and your interpretation of the jesuits' case were distorted.  today there has been an attempt to accuse you. it has been said that the cut in u.s. aid to the salvadoran armed forces is the result of your remarks, rather than of the slowness in the investigation of the jeusit priests' case.  do you think there has been ill intent in this, or that there has been an attempt to take advantage of you to try to justify an action?    (ochoa) i think so. there has been an attempt to blame me, as if i could influence the decision-making of the u.s. congress.  a reduction in military aid to el salvador has been under consideration for months because the expected results have not been obtained.  i think it is ridiculous and childish to say that the aid will be cut as the result of my remarks.  the truth is that all crimes with which some armed forces' members have jeopardized the institution should be punished. my understanding is that solidarity should exist in the context of operations and the fulfillment of the armed forces' constitutional mission.  however, those who harm the institution should not be protected.    i think some are trying to take advantage of the situation, as if to say: col ochoa has endangered the armed forces.  what has endangered the institution is the murder of the jesuits and the san sebastian people.  i canot agree with the perpetration of outrages. one thing is to fight fairly with the enemy.  there are dead in every war.  i said this very clearly when i was 4th infantry brigade commander in cabanas.  i agreed with the penetration into the population to help them.  i feel satisfied over my passage through the armed forces as a commander, because i identified myself both with my men and the civilian population.  at no time did i take advantage of the institution to acquire illegal riches.  to point these things out is not to attack the armed forces.  quite the contrary, it is because i love it that i have criticized the negative members.  the armed forces can thus be spared greater damage by the poor actions of some of its members.    (reporter) colonel, in the past few hours we have heard reports that you are to be supported by the army's younger officers and some unions, even the cel union.  what can you tell us about this situation?

    "doctext": "today the salvadoran defense ministry flatly denied charges raised yesterday by an alleged \"junior officers' command\" that blames certain officers of the armed forces for the murder of the six jesuits.    in a communique released today, the defense ministry categorically rejected \"all types of slander and charges against its members,\" referring to the abovementioned document that it said \"lacks all logic and credibility.\"    the official communique pointed out that \"in these moments, the armed forces are united more than ever before in the defense of the fatherland,\" adding that the document anonymously distributed yesterday to the international press is \"grey propaganda.\"    in the four-page document, a so-called \"junior officers' command\" states that \"colonel hector heriberto hernandez, chief of the treasury police, is responsible for the (jesuits') murders.\"    the authors of the communique add that the \"troops from that security corps led by captain alonso chavez garcia\" carried out the executions,\" but it did not provide any details to back up the accusations.    the six jesuits and two more persons were killed on 16 november, shot during the night by a group of armed individuals wearing military uniforms, according to witnesses of the crime.    the salvadoran government has initiated an investigation, inviting foreign experts to participate.    the official defense ministry note warned that \"the force that maintains this solid unity (of the armed forces) is the blood shed by our soldiers to defend the fatherland and our ideas, customs, religion, democracy, and freedom.\"    the ministry's communique urges the citizens \"not to allow themselves to be deceived by the amount of rumors and psychological pressures that the marxist books of theory clearly define as a form of struggle to achieve power.\"    the communique also discloses that former captain mauricio mena sandoval, who joined the guerrillas in the early eighties, has made telephone calls or sent \"personal notes\" to chiefs or officers.    \"these criminal terrorists resort to this type of psychological tactics when they feel they are lost or desperate,\" the communique adds, referring to the failure of the offensive that the guerrillas launched on 11 november.",

    "doctext": "the farabundo marti national liberation front (fmln) issued a communique a few hours ago denying that it directed an attack against supreme court of justice president mauricio gutierrez castro.    the rebel communique reads: on the afternoon of 2 july, fmln guerrillas carried out propaganda activity and occupied 8 km of the road to la libertad port, between the 14- and 21-km markers, where they erected a barricade.  the guerrillas added that they stopped approximately 200 vehicles to meet and exchange views with the drivers.    at the 14-km marker, a vehicle in which (roberto matis regalado's) bodyguards were riding arrived, but the driver did not obey the order to stop, which provoked a clash with our units.  two men were wounded and one woman was killed as a result of that incident.    our forces reported that they seized one m-16 rifle and one .45 - caliber pistol.  the fmln document adds that minutes later, at the 21-km marker, the supreme court of justice president's bodyguards tried to surprise our fighters and another clash occurred. during the clash, one bodyguard was killed and the arena (nationalist republican alliance) official was wounded.    paragraph three of the communique adds that the armed propaganda activities along the la libertad port - san salvador route are aimed at distributing propaganda and at destabilizing this vital route used by government officials and military men to travel to their private clubs located along the coast.    the fmln, the document adds, reiterates its determination to stop those who are involved in the genocidal war -- those who every day shell the rural areas and persecute and murder peasants, workers, and students -- from taking it easy and relaxing at their clubs and in their exclusive neighborhoods.  the attack on the national police station at the manuel jose arce military neighborhood follows this same line of destabilization.  therefore, we call on our people to pay attention to the recommendations and orders issued by our fighters and to thereby prevent regrettable losses.  we warn bodyguards and security guards that we will fight those who are armed and who offer resistance.    in conclusion, the fmln communique released a few hours ago adds: we reiterate that we will continue to abide by our revolutionary principles and stick to the truth.  we did not participate in incidents such as the attack against (presidency minister) antonio rodriguez porth and edgar chacon (ideologue of the orlando de sola group).  these incidents resulted from a war within arena ranks, and we warn that acts of repression unleashed by the government against the popular and democratic movements will not go unpunished and will receive a strong response from our forces.    this was the recent fmln communique on the incidents that occurred on 2 july on the road to la libertad port, where the president of the supreme court of justice was wounded.",

(reporter) mr. governor, up to now, have eln or epl subversives tried to attain this dialogue?    (assaf) well, no.  it has not been easy, besides we believe these are initiatives that should be started by the peace commissioners, as they have experience in such conversations, contacts, and dialogues. that is why i mentioned that, perhaps, through dr. rafael pardo, who has been the national government's delegate, attempts will be made to search for such possibilities.  i believe the government has been making efforts to attain peace in the country, and the quicker we attain this, the better it will be for the security and stability of colombia.    (reporter) have you already sent an invitation or asked dr.  rafael pardo to come to your department?    (assaf) we have talked to him over the past few days about the public order situation and other situations that require special attention.  however, the entire country knows that dr. pardo has been working virtually full-time to further the peace conversations with m-19.  the entire country has been pleased and very happy with these conversations because they have been an important initiation for president virgilio barco's peace process.    (reporter) but dr. rafael pardo rueda does not dislike the idea of holding such conversations?    (assaf) i am sure he does not dislike the idea because he has been trying to do this for a long time.    (reporter) when could these conversations take place?  just give us a tentative date.  could it be within days or this week?    (assaf) surely this week we will again have to study the public order situation in our department and surely we will be able to analyze this proposal again and i believe dr. pardo will seriously take it into account.    (reporter) some of the country's political leaders -- not only in northern santander, but in several areas of the country -- are very concerned about the constant raids by subversive groups, and their murdered mayors, officials, and political leaders and the kidnapping of national civil registry office personnel.  they indicate that with actions of this type it would be very difficult for people to freely express themselves by voting in the next elections.    (assaf) yes, surely all these incidents can, in a certain manner, weaken the electoral vote.  however, everyday we are more convinced that colombians want to excercise this right without any type of limitations and make efforts -- including heroic actions -- to continue this campaign so that elections can be held throughout the national territory.  voting is the real expression of democracy and we will all fight for it.  we are sure that the government, through the armed forces, will do everything possible for the upcoming elections to be held without problems.  however, it is a huge effort, as it has to confront a series of apprehensions or fears that have been instilled in some people.

    "doctext": "good evening. the electoral campaign is now under way.  ten candidates are running for mayor of lima.  we must participate in the elections to preserve democracy in our country.    however, the electoral atmosphere that prevails should not make us forget our most serious problem, the greatest threat to our fatherland. this threat is terrorism which costs lives, inflicts economic harm, fosters insecurity, and cuts off the power that we need for our homes and our industries.    we continue to battle terrorism. the armed forces and the national police are taking drastic action in the huallaga valley and in the mountain range.  they are also breaking up urban terrorist cells. however, we must also attack terrorists through legal actions, through the most drastic and severe sentences.    irrespective of military actions, if no swift and drastic legal punishment is meted, the terrorists know that they will go unpunished. stimulated by this they continue with their crimes.    the whole country is aware of this. most peruvians want severe, drastic and effective punishment for terrorists. thus, on 28 july i proposed to the national congress that the military courts should try terrorists. tonight, i would like to remind you of this subject because i am concerned that it may remain just that; a proposal. i would also like to ask all peruvians, all organizations and institutions, to support this request which will be discussed in congress.    by having terrorists tried by military courts we are not giving up any civilian prerogatives. we are not giving up any democratic rights. this has been done before in other democratic countries.    furthermore, the armed forces are an essential component of peru's democratic system. they are also the ones that actually fight the battle against subversion. no one can say that setting up military courts is tantamount to militarizing the country because that would imply distrusting the armed forces, offending them and overlooking the fact that they are defending democracy. more than 2 years ago we asked for and were allowed to establish special courts to terrorist cases. so far these courts have yielded no positive results. thus, as president it is my duty to call for severe sentences, issued without delay or any theoretical or academic discussions.    following my 28 july speech i ascertained that the vast majority of peruvians are in favor of drastic punishments and of the establishment of military courts. i have also heard some legal objections and theoretical arguments against this measure.    those who do not want the military courts to try terrorists say that article 282 of the constitution does not allow it. this is half true.  article 282 states: in cases of crimes committed while on duty, police and armed forces members are subject to the military jurisdiction and to the military code of justice which is not applicable to civilians except in the case described by article 235, which establishes the application of the death sentence in case of betrayal of the motherland during war.    now, those who do not want military courts to try terrorists do not want to read the second part of article 282 which states: those who avoid compulsory military service are subject to the military code of justice.  this paragraph is the one that legally and constitutionally allows us to try terrorists under the military jurisdiction, because terrorists also violate the compulsory military service law when they commit crimes.    many peruvians wrongfully think that the compulsory military service only affects men on active service, like those peruvians who, after a selection are sent to serve in a military garrison for 1 or 2 years. this is only one of the ways in which one complies with the compulsory military service.    the compulsory military service law states in article 2: the compulsory military service in an unavoidable duty of all peruvians who must participate in national defense by complying with their military obligations.

(begin recording) (cristiani) although the peace process is under way, we have received reports that the fmln (farabundo marti national liberation front) command has authorized a plan to step up violence in san salvador through the use of ground-to-air missiles.    we believe that this shows absolutely no willingness to bring about peace in our country. the media should reveal to all salvadorans and the entire world what the fmln is planning to do.  (end recording)    according to the president, these fmln plans do not contribute to the peace process that began in september in mexico.  when asked whether these actions planned by the fmln could harm the talks in costa rica, cristiani said that this will depend on the situation that prevails at the meeting.  he added that the salvadoran government opposes the use of the talks for tactical purposes.    (begin recording) (cristiani) if the fmln wants to use the process for tactical purposes, we will not lend ourselves to their game.  our objective has been to seek peace in good will.  however, i repeat, we will not lend ourselves to a fmln tactical game.  i do not believe that we can make any predictions at this moment.  the outcome will depend on these alleged plans and developments in costa rica.

(applause)    no weapon or tactic used in this struggle will be effective enough if it is not combined with resolute efforts to reduce the demand.  the illegal profits are extremely large.  i am certain that we will defeat the drug traffickers in colombia, but someone in some other country, somewhere, will take over this business as long as it remains so profitable.  this happened with marijuana.  when it became too costly for the drug traffickers to operate in colombia because of the effectiveness of the public forces, the traders in vice moved their plantations to california, to hawaii, and to many other regions.  the only law the drug runners do not violate is the law of supply and demand.  (applause)    no society, regardless of how wealthy it is, can afford the luxury of allowing its sons or daughters to poison themselves with cocaine, heroin, marijuana, or any other such deadly drugs.  in this context, i wish to assert that president bush's plan to curb the demand is a first step in the right direction.  we must insist on the message that illegal drugs are not acceptable or harmless, whether they are consumed in the glittering parties of the rich or in the slums.

    "doctext": "when napoleon duarte was proclaimed president of el salvador in 1984, the white house, state department, pentagon, and all the powerful circles in the united states were stricken with euphoria and optimism.  duarte promised a social pact, a tolerant regime, economic and social reforms, and, most important of all, he promised peace.    all of these promises were only a means of achieving washington's great objective: to control the revolution in el salvador or, in other words, counterinsurgency.  five years have passed since then.  in reality 8 years have passed since el salvador became the place where the reagan era's models of counterinsurgency, neodictatorship, and low-intensity warfare were implemented.    washington's euphoria and optimism have completely vanished.  the 19 march elections sealed the collapse of the reagan administration's salvadoran strategy.  two basic factors are at the root of the u.s. failure: first, the united states sought demagogic and politically unsound reforms.  duarte did not in any way improve the masses' extreme poverty and isolation.  second, the revolutionary, popular, and democratic forces' qualitative and quantitative progress was possible because the problems that led to the conflict are--today more than ever--still unresolved.    the 19 march elections resulted in an arena victory, and arena is the party that represents the most ultraconservative oligarchic sectors.  washington has returned to its starting point.  the $3 billion spent on military advice and the genocide of tens of thousands of salvadorans served no purpose whatsoever.  it is all over.  arena represents a return to the system used prior to 15 october 1979.  in other words, it is a return to dictatorial control of all political, economic, and military power.  this is the end, the sad end of the low-intensity war exercise.    u.s. general harry gordon summer, a member of the santa fe group, in his book on the mistakes the united states made in vietnam, said the united states' concept of victory after its defeat in vietnam can no longer be to achieve its enemy's unconditional surrender, as in world war ii, but to achieve the political objectives for which it started the war.  this is precisely the concept of victory used in low-intensity warfare.  arena's victory, and the subsequent return to the old system, is obviously contrary to the objective of low-intensity warfare.    for washington, of course, this defeat means that $3 billion was squandered.  for the salvadoran people and central americans, it means razed towns, devastated economies, and the death of 70,000 people. the new u.s.  administration does not have a definite plan for el salvador.  what it has is an uncomfortable ally, arena, and a social time bomb about to explode.    the fmln believes the bush administration should study the new situation in el salvador and the entire world in a realistic and pragmatic manner.  the war in el salvador continues and will continue as long as there is no change, no real change, to benefit the masses that are struggling for that change.  this is our new reality, and if the new u.s.  administration wants peace and stability in the region, it must establish a foreign policy that reflects that reality.",

    "doctext": "the honduran police today presented to reporters two of the presumed killers of contra commander manuel rugama acevedo, alias \"aureliano.\"  one of the men accused an official of the nicaraguan embassy in tegucigalpa of involvement in the crime.    \"aureliano,\" considered to be the second in command of the nicaraguan contras, was gunned down by an unidentified group in tegucigalpa's northern outskirts on 7 january after attending a working meeting with other rebel leaders.    the police detained hondurans juan bautista and rigoberto matute and nicaraguan luis ordonez, who are being held as suspects in aureliano's murder.  other suspects are still being pursued.    only bautista and ordonez were presented to reporters.  matute is being held outside tegucigalpa as a witness in the case.    ordonez said he \"participated only as a go-between\" so jose de jesus pena, the nicaraguan embassy official, could meet matute, who worked as a messenger for ordonez at the exchange office he runs in tegucigalpa.    ordonez added: \"i was aware that pena wanted to get rid of somebody, but i never learned who they were going to kill until 'aureliano' was eliminated.\"    ordonez also said he worked for the somoza regime, that he later aided the contras financially in honduras, particularly the rebel indian organization misurasata (miskito, sumu, and rama sandinist unity), and that widclife diego, a misurasata leader, owes him $25,000.    ordonez said further that he provided information on the contras several times to the nicaraguan embassy through pena, who gave him $1,000 almost every month.    ordonez denied that he participated directly in the crime: \"on saturday, 7 january, when 'aureliano' was killed, i was at a cock fight in el progreso\" on honduras' northern coast.    ordonez said: \"i also was in touch with the honduran secret police, one of whose lieutenants, working for interpol, called me up a few days ago.  he told me later, however, that other officers wanted to see me.  that is how i was detained.\"    in addition, bautista claimed that he was hired by matute during two meetings they held and that matute offered to pay him $10,000 to kill somebody, presumably a contra commander who also intended to kill matute.    bautista said that a few days prior to the crime, matute introduced to him another person, cano arteaga, who is still at large and who told bautista that it was ordonez who wanted the man dead.    bautista said that, on the day of the crime, he met with matute and cano.  they drove around the place several times until they intercepted the contra commander's car.    \"i opened fire with a .38 caliber revolver.  aureliano got out of the car and was hit by matute's shots.  cano finished him off.\"    bautista said his two companions were armed with .45 caliber pistols.  after the crime, they went their separate ways to wait to receive the promised money in a tegucigalpa park on 15 february.    police sources and colonel manuel enrique suarez, head of the honduran armed forces' public relations department, who presented the criminals to the reporters, declined to comment on the involvement of a nicaraguan embassy official in the crime.    suarez said: \"it is up to the honduran government to comment on this case or to try to establish whether a diplomat participated.  the police have already done their duty.\"    there was nobody available at the nicaraguan embassy in tegucigalpa to comment on the alledged involvement of one of the embassy officials in the assassination.  the embassy would neither confirm nor deny that someone named jose de jesus pena worked there.",

    "doctext": "dear radio audience: first of all, i want to thank you for allowing me to talk to you tonight about a very important issue for the future of our country.  many times you have heard us mention the word solidarity.  we have always used it as a word that means to think about those who suffer the most, those who have less.  indeed, those are the people we must help, even with our own sacrifice, and many times with a huge sacrifice by all of us.  if love is the bond that unites family members, solidarity should be the great pillar, the cement that unites salvadoran society, so that, united, we may fulfill our desire for peace, tranquility, happiness, and well-being.    however, tonight allow me to give you two examples of what we consider should be the use of the word solidarity and what this word means in matters that are completely different from one another.  a few weeks ago the government was forced, due to an increase in oil prices, to raise the price of oil byproducts such as gasoline, diesel, and all fuels.  in the past, the government subsidized gasoline. perhaps the government did this to make people believe this would have nothing but positive effects.  however, let us analyze for a while the issue of increases in the price of fuel.  when a government has no money for subsidizing, that means the cost of living will go up. there is no doubt that prices will rise when a government spends more than what it has.  however, let us see how this aspect, or rather the principle of solidarity, applies to the increase in fuel prices, especially the price of gasoline.    ten percent of all families in our country own a vehicle.  in general, that 10 percent are those who have the most; in other words, those who have the possibility of buying a car, a vehicle.  if we subsidized gasoline, what we would be doing is taking money out of a government that, for the time being, does not have such funds available.  in order to get such funds, the government would have to impose new taxes which would affect all salvadorans.  therefore, let us think whether or not it is fair that 90 percent of all salvadoran families, who own no vehicles, must pay some kind of tax in order to benefit the other 10 percent who have the resources that allow them to buy a vehicle.    we do not want to appear as demagogic or populist with this example.  what we want to say is that those of us who own a vehicle, who are part of the 10 percent lucky enough to have something and thus can buy a vehicle, must be in solidarity with that 90 percent who have little and many times nothing.  they have no vehicles, and therefore have no reason to suffer so the gasoline we buy becomes cheaper. moreover, to some extent the current price of gasoline makes it possible for the diesel supplied to urban and interurban bus companies to be bought at a price that will allow bus owners to maintain the current bus fares.  this is solidarity, and even more than that. those of us who have something, who own a vehicle, pay something -- through the price of the gasoline we consume -- so that those who own nothing and must use the public transportation buses can do so with no price increase.    the same should be the case for the cost of liquid gas and propane gas, so that the prices of food cooked with gas in the marketplaces are not increased.  this is an example of how those of us who have something can show our solidarity with those who have little or nothing at all.    i would now like to talk about an example of an even deeper kind of solidarity.  i want to talk about peace.  salvadoran brothers, this is the time when we must show our solidarity with those mothers who have lost their sons.  we must show our solidarity with the innocent children who could kick a mine and end up without an arm or a leg.  we must show our solidarity with those who, because of violence, cannot find a job.  that is why this is the time for all of us to make an effort to achieve peace.    last thursday i told you i felt more optimistic after meeting with the political parties and listening to their decision to accept the challenge to work for peace.  they are determined to reach a consensus to fulfill the aspirations of all salvadorans.  we are beginning to sense what the near future of el salvador could be.  we are feeling happy and optimistic.  however, i repeat, this is the time when we should all contribute to peace.    anything that may lead to violence, whether it is street disturbances or bombs, should not be permitted, because it is no longer conceivable for mothers, children, and families to continue to suffer in our country.  the time has come to show our solidarity, to search, not only through words but also through our examples and actions, for the peace that our country and salvadorans deserve.    therefore, our solidarity should be the fundamental tool for our country's reconstruction.  it should be the fundamental tool for the physical and spiritual reconstruction of all salvadorans.  we want all salvadorans, without exception, to support the peace efforts, so that those who suffer so very much from violence will no longer suffer.    this is a fundamental step forward for the freedom and democracy of the salvadoran people.  salvadoran brothers, let us show our solidarity in this crucial time in our history, because we have always known that when all salvadorans act positively like brothers, we can come out ahead.  this is all for tonight.  thank you all very much and may god bless you.",

    "doctext": "medellin mayor juan gomez martinez once more insisted today on \"an immediate dialogue\" between the government and the cocaine traffickers \"to end the war in which innocent people are being killed.\"    the mayor reiterated his position when he commented on the attack in which 20 persons were killed and approximately 100 were injured, which was perpetrated yesterday by terrorists on the drug cartel's payroll near itagui municipality.    the blast from the explosion hit a truck full of policemen, who had earlier carried out an anti-mafia operation in a peasant village, as well as several public buses, houses, and businesses.    a police expert said that the car bomb (containing 300 kg of dynamite) was activated by remote control as the elite force patrol passed by.    according to gomez martinez, \"these actions will only cease when (president virgilio barco vargas') government puts aside so much prejudice and agrees to the peace talks,\" proposed by the subversives.    \"the dialogue will take place sonner or later, and it is better to start now,\" insisted the mayor of medellin, a city where the world's most powerful cartel has its base of operations.    the chief of the criminal gang, pablo escobar gaviria, ordered the assassination of medellin policemen in retaliation for the government's action against the drug traffickers.  twenty-eight policemen have been killed in this city over the last two weeks.    according to security organizations, yesterday's attack \"could be escobar gaviria's response to the arrest of adolfo mesa meneses,\" his right-hand man.    mesa meneses was arrested last week by the administrative department of security (das, secret police), and the authorities have accused him of assassinating -- on orders from the mafia leader -- leftist presidential candidate bernardo jaramillo ossa, as well as a chief of police, a mayor, and several journalists.    meanwhile, hundreds of soldiers, policemen, and detectives are carrying out large-scale operations in the colombian countryside and border areas on the suspicion that escobar gaviria plans to flee the country.    last night, a television newscast showed photographs of the \"drug lord\" that had been \"recently\" taken by security organizations at a colombian beach on the pacific coast.    a police department spokesman confirmed today that \"we have reliable information on his whereabouts,\" although he refrained from giving further details.  unofficial sources said that escobar gaviria \"is somewhere in western antioquia department\" -- of which medellin is the capital -- where the search operations are concentrated.    colombian authorities have also asked for the cooperation of brazil, ecuador, panama, peru, and venezuela to stop the drug traffickers from escaping to those countries.",

    "doctext": "lawyer carlos oldiney reported the gang and federal agents valdemir lopez prazeres and luis jose da conceicao and detectives paulo massanhyo and carlos angel serrano castilesso were arrested.    cambaralamaia's organization is just one of the many gangs in the region that deals with bolivian cocaine.  another gang is led by gerson palermo, of umuarama, parana state, who controls the exchange of cocaine to paraguay for stolen brazilian cars.  palermo owns four twin-engined cessna planes and employs more than 200 men.  he also exchange cars for cocaine in bolivia.  although sentenced by the brazilian courts, palermo lives in pedro juan caballero, paraguay, where he maintains business contacts with the bolivian coca producers. palermo obtains ether and acetone, which are essential for refining the drug, from argentina.    the federal police believes that the drug might be refined in mato grosso do sul, near some residences in the dourados and campo grande sectors.  palermo exchanges the chemicals for tons of cocaine paste which, in the opinion of regional federal police delegate francisco viana queiroz, is also processed in paraguay.  viana queiroz maintains that the drug is refined by a group of traffickers led by arsenio benitez gonzalez, who is known as vilhar and who lives in asuncion. the federal police believe that vilhar -- who is believed to be palermo's partner -- is the brazilian traffickers' main cocaine supplier.    according to the police, two drug routes pass through mato grosso do sul: the ponta pora route (which is used by palermo), and the corumba route, which passes through the bolivian town of puerto suarez.  many traffickers come to this bolivian town, most of them small suppliers who only want to exchange cocaine for cars that were stolen in brazil.  according to the authorities, the corumba route is more important because it channels the so-called \"mini-traffic.\"  this involves hundreds of people who, together, make up a sizable quantity of drugs every day.    the cars are the hard currency used in these transactions.  most of them are taken to bolivia after having been stolen in sao paulo.  they follow the same route as the bolivian cocaine, that is, via puerto suarez.  the most important part of the trafficking, however, is carried out in paraguay and bolivia.  gerson palermo is responsible for part of it, while the rest is shared by hundreds of bolivian traffickers.  palermo obtains ether and acetone from formosa, argentina.  he takes these chemicals aboard small planes to the towns of pilar or encarnacion, in paraguay. from there, another group takes the 200-liter drums along the chaco highway to puerto guarani, in bolivia.  bolivian traffickers take care of the rest of the journey to santa cruz de la sierra.  in return, palermo receives cocaine paste which is shipped to asuncion and, from there, to pedro juan caballero for distribution to the processing units.  it is believed that the traffickers use some ranches near porto murtinho (mato grosso de sul), near the paraguayan town of bahia negra, to process large quantities of cocaine.    no cocaine paste is usually available along the corumba route.  the drug is refined because it is relatively easy to find ether and acetone in corumba, where the federal police have failed to reduce the large demand for such chemicals in retail stores.  dozens of drugstores sell those products by the liter, and this is not forbidden by law.    the authorities estimate that production in the puerto suarez region nears 300 kg per week, which is transported by railroad, air, and land.  in an attempt to evade the federal police, traffickers have tried to transport the drug inside their bodies, in wine demijohns, and even in children's diapers.  these traffickers generally travel by bus or by train. over the past 6 months the police caught dozens of traffickers using these methods.  now, however, only with the complicity of the police can cars carrying bolivian cocaine produced in the puerto suarez region reach campo grande.",

    "doctext": "mr. president, when one sees peru facing the difficulties it is experiencing now, the same as our own country and latin america in general, one asks himself: would a man, a novelist like mario vargas llosa, be the right man to lead peru?    (garcia) as president of all peruvians -- and of vargas llosa to even if he does not like it -- i cannot pass judgment, either ethically or intellectually, on a politician and peruvian who is contending for the presidency.    (reporter) what are you going to do after you step down from the presidency?    (garcia) well, i am going to be free.    (amat) why do you not come to colombia and i am sure...    (garcia, interrupting) sure, i accept your invitation, and i hope some colombians will extend it.  however, i want to tell you very honestly, that i am perhaps better at selling dreams, ideas, and doctrines than at administering a situation of penury, like the one our countries are experiencing, and most particularly peru, which is one of the poorest countries in latin america.  it is very difficult. for instance, on a day when the price of rice or chicken goes up, the people will not believe you, even if you tell them the greatest of truths.  one can be preaching something very important, but if it failed to rain and the city had no water no one will believe of you the greatest of all truths.  then, when one stops being president and administering penury, one can devote oneself to convincing people, to educating.  that is what i should do.    (amat) now, why did you make that aside, making me president of all peruvians, even of vargas llosa?  whether he likes or not it hurts him.    (garcia) because i am sure that some people would not like to have me as president.  (laughter)    (amat) even him, for instance?    (garcia) i did not say so.  i do not know.  i never fall to the level of defining people or pointing out last names.  i make an outline or define them in the negative.    (amat) mr. president, (words indistinct) this dialogue (words indistinct) for your generosity and kindness.  addressing our people and our country, (words indistinct), how were things today at the summit?    (garcia) very well.  colombians, who have seen their institution threatened, their press abused, and many politicians also threatened, must have confidence that latin america, together with the united states, will confront the problem of drug trafficking.  this is not only a problem for colombia.  it is our problem too, and we will tackle it.  the day a newspaper was blown up in bogota i came to bogota because i felt that freedom of the press was threatened on the continent.  after all, we are latin americans.  let colombians have confidence.",

    "doctext": "the chief of the armed forces joint chiefs of staff (colonel rene emilio ponce) has categorically denied that there are any rifts between salvadoran army officers and u.s. military advisers, as asserted by the washington post.  the newspaper stated that the alleged rift between the military officers began once it was discovered who was responsible for the death of six jesuit priests, in which one colonel, two lieutenants, and six soldiers are being charged.    colonel ponce said that the relations with u.s. advisers -- about 52 in the country -- are very cordial.    (begin recording) (ponce) our relations with the north americans are normal as usual.  the u.s. advisers have helped us very much in the professionalization of the armed forces, and they continue working with us.    (reporter) where do you think these wire reports stating there are rifts between salvadoran military officers and u.s.  advisers have orginiated?    (ponce) i do not know; i cannot understand.  there are always those who try to break the strategic alliance between the salvadoran government and armed forces and the united states.  this is a poor country that depends a great deal on u.s. economic and military aid.    (reporter) following the murder of the jesuits, what are relations like between the salvadoran military and the gringo advisers?    (ponce) as usual, these relations are very cordial, and they continue to work with us.  as you can see, two advisers are here with me now at the table presiding over the event.  the same has been the case with all the units in the country's interior.  i fail to see any difference in relations before and afterward. (end recording)    the military chief repeated the need to maintain the state of emergency, not only due to the guerrilla attacks, but also to keep control over the organization fronts just prior to an expected wave of protests on the latest government economy measures.    (begin recording) (ponce) we must start thinking what may happen to domestic order in the face of the economic measures that have been issued or are planned.  we must think what the reaction of the people or the fmln (farabundo marti national liberation front) organization fronts will be, as they always use any excuse to disrupt domestic order.  it would be good to look into what is needed to maintain domestic order in the country. (end recording)    the high-ranking military officer gave these statements at the ceremony to turn over command of the captain general gerardo barrios military academy.  the new commander is colonel ricardo alfonso casanova sandoval, who replaces colonel guillermo alfredo benavides moreno, removed from his post after being accused of ordering the murder of the jesuit priests.    meanwhile, colonel hector heriberto hernandez has been appointed commander of the 6th infantry brigade based in usulutan, and in la union department the change of command ceremonies of the armed forces military training center have taken place, where colonel francisco arturo lopez will be in command replacing colonel carlos alfredo rivas, who has been transferred to the joint chiefs of staff.",

(moderator) pablo guillermo (words indistinct).    (reporter) mr. president, the newspaper la jornada of mexico stated yesterday that colonel orlando zepeda had left the country this weekend with all his family and with a considerable amount of luggage, which would indicate that he did not go on a mere vacation.  i would like to know the official version of this. (laughter)    (cristiani) you say he left when?    (reporter) yesterday.    (cristiani) well, only if he left very hurriedly after midday.  i was with him here yesterday discussing other things, as well as military matters with the defense minister and deputy ministers.  he was present.  unless he may have left.  i doubt it very much, because i had a meeting with them to see the order of the month on saturday and he was present.  pardon me, that was tuesday when we had the order for the end of the month.  i understand he was present at the commanders meeting.  if he left last weekend, it must have been for the weekend and he returned on monday.    (moderator) maria cortina, notimex.    (reporter) mr. president, in what way would a cut in military aid affect the peace process?    (cristiani) we are currently seeing opposite signs from the fmln in terms of wanting to truly put an end to violence.  a sign of this was the night of 1 may when the attacks were carried out.  this would indicate that, although not all the fmln command, that is the five groups, some groups seem to resist a political solution and favor a military solution, as they have insisted on pursuing for 10 years. those groups could view a cut in military aid as a sign of weakening of the government and the armed forces, and that consequently they would have a better chance of being successful following the military path.  that could increase the potential of a military solution in the minds of some.  this could reduce the potential of seriously considering a political solution to the conflict.    (moderator) raul monge, cadena radio centro.    (reporter) mr. president, how do you view the guerrillas' morale at this moment?    (cristiani) well, i obviously cannot but believe that the morale of the guerrillas after the offensive must have dropped considerbly. this is especially so since there was a large sacrifice on their part in the form of casualties and the fact that the offensive did not represent a success, despite their claim that it was only a show of force, which is a lot of malarkey.  all the prior documents indicated that this was a large-scale operation to the hilt seeking to overthrow the government and to crown a military victory.  what i believe was of even greater impact was that they realized that the people of el salvador do not support them and do not support the path of violence. in that sense, their hopes of a popular insurrection were shattered. on the contrary, the people did not support the fmln and instead turned their backs on them and showed that they do not support violence.  this must have caused an impact on the fmln and its members.  i recently read in a venezuelan newspaper statements by a commander, whose pseudonym is gustavo, who said that they were tired of following the path of violence and that a solution had to be found. this demonstrates that some of their ranks are getting tired of the military path.  these are indications of what could be.  what i want to clear up once and for all is that we do not react to whether or not the fmln feels strong or feels weak.  we know that 100 terrorists in a country can cause destruction and death and that is what we are trying to avoid, although 100 terrorists are not a force that will destabilize a government.  however, the damage that they cause is such that we do not want it to continue.

(reporter) (words indistinct) what are you doing to prepare the commission that is to hold talks (words indistinct)?    (cristiani) the terrorists will not of course be successful with actions of this kind and will not provoke us into violent action. they should understand by now that the government is searching for peace and wants to achieve peace within el salvador's legal framework and by applying the law.  the fmln rebels should understand that their terrorist actions will not lead us to take rash actions; it is useless for them to continue to act in this way.    we are continuing our work on setting up the commission.  today we will speak with two people who have still not told us if they will accept my invitation to be commission members.  the names of the commission members will be released to the public once the commission is fully formed.    (reporter) (words indistinct) the catholic church's role in this commission?    (cristiani) (words indistinct) the catholic church will not be represented in this commission because it is a political commission and not one in which the church can effectively participate.  the church has always worked for peace and has made all possible efforts to find peace for the country the church will continue to work toward this goal.  however, i believe that the church has a different role to play in the search for peace, and that role is not serving on the political commission.    (reporter) what would you say is the biggest obstacle you have encountered in the month that you have served as president?    (cristiani) i believe that the biggest obstacle has been our inability to launch our government program, which is due to the state of affairs existing in the former administration when we took over. we have repeatedly observed this state of affairs in the majority of government (word indistinct).  throughout government offices, disorder was rampant, and, in many cases, we have observed that government offices were managed irresponsibly.  moreover, the nation's public finances have greatly deteriorated.  we have inherited a country in very bad financial shape, and, i believe, this has delayed the launching of our government program. (end recording)    cristiani, referring to costa rican president oscar arias' offer to hold a dialogue with the rebels in costa rican territory, said that the offer was a great contribution toward convincing the fmln to stop murdering defenseless citizens.",

(gonzalez) i believe that the cristiani government is closing all the roads to a peaceful solution of this conflict.  through repression it is closing off the possibility of labor unions and associations resolving their problems peacefully.  the government is closing off the possibility of negotiations.  the army and the cristiani government are opposed to true negotiations.  the people have no alternative.  in el salvador there is a latent path, the path of armed actions.  at this moment, as this government increases repression, armed actions become increasingly legitimate, armed actions to find solutions to the conflict, armed actions to stop the repression by the regime.    the workers and their associations and labor unions are entitled to defend themselves and their labor benefits.  defense is legitimate. it is legitimate for the workers to decide to defend themselves the armed way, through violence.  it is the cristiani government, ponce, and the high command who are leaving the workers no alternative.    (reporter) to conclude, commander: in recent hours there have been attacks in the capital, including bomb attacks on the residences of democratic leaders such as ruben zamora and aronete diaz, an attack on the residence of colonel carranza, and an attack on a relative of colonel lopez huila, among others.  the armed forces and the government have publicly said that the fmln is responsible for these attacks.    (gonzalez) our armed actions are highly just and have political motivations.  our objectives are strictly military.  all our guerrilla units function according to this principle, be it in the rural areas or in the cities where our urban commandos operate.    the attack on the armed forces staff installations and other operations against military targets are our responsibility.  the fmln's policy is not to attack relatives of military men or politicians.  the high command has been trying to confuse the people here and abroad.  what is its objective?  to cover up its repressive policy.  it is escalating its actions.  it has gone from the selective capture and murder of leaders to mass arrests, and from mass arrests it has moved into genocide and indiscriminate attacks.    it is clear that its objective is the social organizations.  the government said it in san jose.  it is evident that the high command is trying to create confusion, but the people abroad and we know that our actions are aimed at military objectives.",

    "doctext": "the extraditables, the armed branch of the medellin cartel, denied today in a telephone call to a radio station by an alleged member, any responsibility for the death of carlos pizarro, political leader and former guerrilla commander.    the caller identified himself as john jairo arias tascon.  he called the caracol network in medellin to denounce that the charges against the medellin cartel are part of a plan to blame them for all violent actions in the country.    the authors of the assassination are sectors who seek to destabilize the country, arias tascon added.    pizarro, former leader of the 19 april movement (m-19), the guerrilla group that laid down its weapons on 9 march, was killed by the impact of three bullets fired at him aboard a colombian avianca flight that was en route to the city of barranquilla along the country's atlantic coast.    after the crime, at 1100 (1600 gmt), an individual who identified himself as sapatoca called caracol to report that the killing had been ordered by fidel castano and henry perez, heads of the extreme rightist paramilitary militias.    sapatoca added that castano and perez perpetrated the crime following orders from the extraditables.    castano was connected to the death of bernardo jaramillo, also a presidential candidate, for the leftist patriotic union (up), on 22 march, although at that time it was reported that castano headed a paramilitary organization that did not implicate the extraditables.    on that occasion pablo escobar, leader of the extraditables and the medellin cartel, denied that the drug traffickers had killed jaramillo.    a confidential report drafted recently by the administrative department of security (das, colombian secret police), said that some army and police members cooperate with castano's criminal organization.    navarro wolff, number two leader of m-19, told newsmen today after pizarro was killed that his burial must be attended by all the country, because we must repudiate crime such as this.    navarro wolff said that pizarro's death shows that the country is in turmoil and that it will be very difficult to rebuild the country. there is no space except for pain and for ire, he added.    the burial of carlos must be peaceful, as was m-19's example of peace given to the country, he added.    it is hard to explain how things such as this occur when the m-19 and carlos pizarro were setting an example of prudence, tolerance, and understanding, navarro said.    pizarro, a former guerrilla commander who led his armed group toward demobilization after 17 months of political negotiations with the government of virgilio barco, told newsmen before boarding the aircraft: we are doing well. this was a reference to the m-19 electoral campaign.    pizarro stated in his last public statement: i am certain that we will know how to wage opposition.  we will engage in a very pretty democratic play with regard to the next government.  we will participate in building new colombian democracy.    the m-19 participated for the first time in the 11 march elections, becoming the third political force in bogota.    nothing has been said yet concerning the burial of pizarro, who was born 39 years ago in cartagena de indias and who leaves three orphan daughters, aged 12, 9, and 4.",

(ponce) i believe that specific measures we have adopted have given us good results.  they have launched four sa-7's in the zacatecoluca area; however, our pilots have skillfully avoided the rockets or missiles, which did not hit their aircraft.  we are adopting measures that are giving results.  we must also clarify that we feel that since the light aircraft transporting these missiles did not have a normal landing and the missiles were not in their original package, it is possible that they suffered some functional damage when the plane crashed south of zacatecoluca.  thank god, (words indistinct)    (reporter) do you think that the summit of central american presidents can open new possibilities for resuming talks with the fmln?  do you think that this summit could bring about new steps toward a dialogue?    (ponce) yes, i think that the salvadoran government since the beginning of the year has opened this possibility and is willing to talk on a permanent basis.  i think that at this time it would be a positive step in the political field.    however, in the military field, where the fmln has attacked us in an irrational and violent way in the main cities, the armed forces is replying, and we will continue to reply.  we will completely defeat the fmln.    based on the information we have received from our units, we have inflicted 1,902 dead, 1,209 wounded, and 44 terrorists have deserted and turned themselves in to the authorities.  we have confiscated a large number of weapons.  i will give you the quantities: 25 antiaircraft missiles -- one red eye and 24 sa-7's -- 915 rifles, 12 carbines, 11 shotguns, 156 grenade and rocket launchers, 49 mortars, 45 machineguns, 41 submachineguns, 67 revolvers and pistols, 23 radios, and a large amount of explosives.    i must stress that the fmln has gathered all these weapons with suppport from abroad.  it is a large arsenal.    i must also note that many of the weapons we found had been abandoned, which means that the fmln has had many desertions.  we have also found weapons in houses, thanks to the collaboration of the civilian population.    we have also learned that the fmln has kidnapped a large number of youths here in the san salvador area and mainly in usulutan, as well as in chalatenango.  this means that they are trying to fill in the number of casualties they have suffered with youths.  this also means that their efficiency will be very low.    (reporter) i do not know if you have seen over the past few days a leaflet issued by the air force, which was dropped from airplanes and also distributed on the streets.  the leaflet urges salvadoran patriots to defend their homeland, their properties, and lives.  it also says that if necessary, terrorists must be killed, as well as their internationalist allies.  what is your opinion of this leaflet? is it not an invitation to kill foreigners in this country?    (ponce) i do not think so, because the leaflets mention internationalists, who are fighting along with the fmln.  (continued)",

(begin recording) (merino) what they are showing is that they are bent on carrying out totally destructive actions to lower the confidence of the population and to provoke general panic.  i think that although as a government we have always maintained a conciliatory position to attain peace in el salvador, we must also make a firmer decision to take stronger action.  the people who commit these wanton actions are deranged people.  they do not understand words.  they do not understand that they must respect a legal system, or a democratic process or one of humanization.  they are simply beasts and murderers and must be treated as such.  (end recording)    merino said the murderers must be punished with the full weight of the laws, and that one of the terrorists who was wounded and captured at the site of the crime is under interrogation.    (begin recording) (merino) one of the criminals was wounded.  this will obviously enable us to obtain some clues as to the identity of the actual killers and of the masterminds of this new murder, which has shocked salvadoran society.    as in previous cases, we are conducting investigations in this case.  however, i repeat that the time has come for us to take a firmer stand, to do our utmost, and to realize that if nothing has happened to us thus far, it does not mean we will not fall victim to these murderers.  it is better to take precautions now than to have regrets later.  (end recording)    merino said that this campaign of violence promoted by the terrorist hordes has not ended.  clear evidence of this is this brutal and cowardly murder, which has again filled the suffering salvadoran people with sorrow.",

(end recording)    finance minister shim'on peres' draft law on streamlining bureaucracy was approved today in the cabinet by a large majority of 14 to 2.  sharp exchanges between the finance minister and some likud ministers took place.  our economic correspondent yaron kulas reports:    (begin recording) (kulas) the debate on the draft law on slashing bureaucracy reopened the loud disagreement between the finance minister and likud ministers moshe nisim, roni milo, and ehud olmert. only two ministers objected to the proposal: 'ezer weizman, who said that the true economic problem today is the intifadah; and ecology and environmental protection minister roni milo.  (passage omitted)    ten ministers abstained from voting.  the plan was endorsed, however, by a large majority.  the knesset will convene to ratify the draft law early next week.  (end recording)",

(begin recording) (estrada) i believe it is incomplete because we do not yet know who committed the crimes.  we only know that they belong to an institution, and this of course is only partial information.    (reporter) did you know that the government was going to make this announcement last night, or was it a surprise?    (estrada) i think it was a surprise because we had been in touch with the president and with the crime commission, which is the one carrying out the investigations on orders from the president and the government.  they promised us that if we were to cooperate by providing information, they would do everything possible to resolve the problem and carry out the investigations.    at that point i was skeptical, because the persons who have testified have accused the armed forces, and i had never seen a salvadoran president or the armed forces making a serious effort to clean up its image and carry out investigtions to put members of the armed forces in prison.  i was skeptical.  i had never seen that happen, but facts show that i was mistaken. (end recording)    father estrada has admitted that there has been international pressure to have this case investigated, but he optimistically believes that the decision to investigate has been adopted also for the sake of the prestige of the armed forces.    (begin recording) (estrada) i am inclined to believe that the armed forces are acting not only as a result of pressure, but also because they could be denied military or economic aid.  i believe that a crime such as the one being investigated goes against the very essence of the armed forces, which exists to protect the citizens, not to harm them. (end recording)    father estrada said he trusts in the moral strength of president cristiani to see this case through to the end.  he cautioned, however, that so far nothing new has been said and that a listing of the people involved and a just sentence would be news.",

(begin recording) (nunez allende) we will be responsible for the security of the population and of the foreign guests in keeping with our duty requirements.  as for the recent attacks, i must say they are regrettable and i wish they had not taken place, however, this kind of action has been taken into consideration in all our plans.  we have adopted all the measures we think are appropriate in case this kind of activity takes place.  we will also try to prevent this kind of action during the presidential inauguration so that people under our protection will not be affected.    (unidentified reporter) why has terrorist activity increased in the past few days?    (nunez allende) i think that this is normal within the current process, it is not a specific factor or objective.  the attacks are in keeping with what we have been observing in the past few months.  (end recording)    the carabineros order and security chief also reported that reinforcements will be brought in to santiago from other parts of the country, and he added that the dissolution of the national intelligence center will not affect the normal work of the carabineros.  he also said that in face of the recent terrorist attacks, the appropriate measures have been adopted.  as far as he knew, he said, the army will not participate in establishing order and security during the transfer of power ceremony; this will be exclusive responsibility of chilean carabineros.    as for the recent terrorist attacks, he said there is no evidence that they are part of a plan, although he admitted that extremist activity has increased lately.  however, such actions are within what was expected.  he said that the security personnel that will be brought in by the foreign guests have already coordinated their actions with those of carabineros.    on 5 march, the carabineros will announce a detailed report on the transfer of power ceremony and on the measures that will be adopted, especially regarding the circulation of cars.  the security plan will be similar to the one used during pope john paul ii's visit to chile.",

(passage omitted)    (garcia) let me now say a few words about a different subject, the establishment of relations with north korea. i believe the opposition has raised a tempest in a teacup; it has raised an issue that is of no relevance to the peruvian people.  first, we uphold the concept of universality of relations, of maintaining relations with all nations. colombian president virgilio barco established relations with north korea a few months ago; he did not have to face a savage opposition telling him that he was throwing himself into the arms of terrorism. nobody has complained to carlos andres perez or to salinas de gortari about maintaining relations with north korea.  for that matter, nobody has objected in bolivia, austria, or sweden, because in those countries there is no reactionary right to argue that to recognize north korea is to court destruction.    second, someone -- and i do not want to mention him by name -- has said that relations have been established with a terrorist state. this is a tremendous error, because 20,000 rifles sold to us by north korea at $90 apiece -- $10 less than anywhere in the world -- have made it possible to save and defend the lives of tens of thousands of civilian guards from the national police and have made it possible to eliminate and eradicate subversion in many parts of the country.    third, international relations are not designed to be auctioned off to the highest bidder.  if so we would have to break relations with australia or with finland.  one must maintain relations with all the peoples of the world.  under such criteria, since peru recognizes the frg, it should close its embassy in the communist gdr.  this manichean criterion, this obtuse criterion, this outmoded criterion is no longer valid; the berlin wall has been razed.  how can one say that this country should be recognized and another shouldn't?  peru will not accept any imperialist veto on its world relations.  we have had enough of the 1960's and 1970's when passports said we could not travel to the soviet union or cuba.  peruvians have the right to travel wherever they wish, like they wish, and when they wish.  this is freedom, and it cannot be curtailed by the establishment of off-limits areas around the globe.    finally, several of the gentlemen who now oppose the establishment of relations with north korea have been honored, illustrious guests of the north korean government.  the other day i heard some people speaking vehemently on this topic, while some other people nearby had been honored guests there.  journalists can seek out and determine how many of those who now oppose these relations have been honored guests in north korea for weeks.  now, for political reasons, they are opposed to the establishment of relations with north korea.

(words indistinct) the u.s.  ambassador and u.s. embassy personnel are fully aware of this.    the need to come up with this version comes from the precarious predicament that the government and the armed forces have found themselves in in view of the debates taking place in the u.s. congress to decide the fate of aid to el salvador, which is linked to the results of the investigation of the assassination of the jesuit priests on 16 november.",

(begin recording) (cerezo) we have proposed a 20-year term to restructure the debt, with a six-year grace period, at four percent interest.  obviously, this has not been the usual procedure at the venezuelan investment fund nor is this included in the san jose agreement.  for these reasons, because this proposal does not fit venezuelan law, we need to discuss and adjust the terms to the law and the san jose agreement.  however, there is willingness to discuss the terms.  we will obviously have to make the same proposal to the mexican government, from whom we expect the same attitude and understanding, and we are certain we will have it. (end recording)    within the formal cerezo visit, two important agreements between venezuela and guatemala were signed today.  one of them is a cooperation and friendship agreement.  another is a scientific and technological cooperation agreement in energy and mining matters, which will strengthen bilateral relations.  as energy and mines minister celestino armas said upon signing the agreements, this will permit carrying out joint oil exploration operations.    (begin recording) (armas) for example, in the area of oil exploration, there are very interesting prospects in guatemala that could result in great interest for guatemala and for venezuela.  with regard to mining, we have been discussing the possibility of making some progress in the mining sector in guatemala and the possibility of helping guatemala discover mineral deposits that could be very attractive for our economies. (end recording)    following the news conference held at the miraflores palace, guatemalan president vinicio cerezo went to the cela (economic comission for latin america).  the cerezo agenda included a dinner he will host tonight for his counterpart carlos andres perez.",

    "doctext": "die welt: your thoughts are focused on chile, but let us briefly look at europe nevertheless.  the democratic revolution in east europe has also been a sensation to chile.  what hopes do you place in these gigantic radical changes?    aylwin: i think that the changes in east europe are of very great importance for mankind.  they give us satisfaction and hope.  the opening of the berlin wall symbolizes the beginning of a new era in relations between east and west as well as the desire of the germans to achieve unity again.  we would like to see this situation lead to a reduction in military spending and to closer relations between the peoples.    die welt: what effects do you see for a third world country such as chile?    aylwin: i see two effects.  first, a symbolic effect.  chile is traditionally a democratic country.  now the long period of a dictatorial regime is ending, however.  this explosion of freedom coincides with the restoration of democracy in chile.  that is a stimulating feeling.  we are embarking on the road of humanity. second, there is a lot of talk about the danger of communism in our country; people say that communism could jeopardize our democratic future.  i think that the events in east europe and the soviet union demonstrate that communism is no longer a danger for the world.  nor for chile.    die welt: chile has the best organized communist party in latin america.  has this party changed?  what was its reaction?    aylwin: little is known about the situation of such a monolithic and coherent party.  it was illegal and worked underground for a long time.  however, i do not believe that any communist party can ignore the events in that part of the world which has so far been dominated by communist parties.  the chilean communist party leaders have admitted that this is a universal process.    die welt: what relationship do you have with volodia teitelboim, the general secretary of the communist party?  do you speak with him? do you see him sometimes?    aylwin: we have known each other from the time when we were both senators, meaning prior to 1973.  we were political opponents, but we often talked with each other.  since then, we have met only once, at a political function.  my rivals in this election campaign have often misrepresented our relationship, and have described me as teitelboim's secret ally.  however, i think that people of different persuasions can talk with each other and can reach agreement.  that has been done in chile with some success.    die welt: the communist party backed your candidacy.  will it be represented in the new government?    aylwin: not at all.    die welt: but the future government will be a left-center government and will reflect the composition of the opposition today.    aylwin: yes, chile will have a left-center government.  the various socialist currents will be represented.  however, the strongest movement is the christian democratic party which is in the center.    die welt: do you think that following these elections, the panorama of the opposition will change?    aylwin: i have no doubt about that.  there have been four families in the past -- the christian democratic family, the social democratically-oriented family of the old radical party, the socialist family, and the family of the right center.  they all want to survive.    die welt: many people say that the socialist ricardo lagos is the strongest figure of the opposition alliance.  what role will he play in the future?    aylwin: he will concentrate on parliamentary work as a senator.  as is the case in every parliamentary democracy, he cannot be a member of the government as a representative of congress.

(azcona) no, there is no unrest because of laws passed by congress. some measures that have affected income have been adopted, but we will make progress anyhow.    (giron) will you ask that some of these laws be reconsidered?    (azcona) no, i am not going to do that.  there is, however, the law on coffee taxes which could be discussed with producers because the law-decree on coffee is very drastic.  however, the country is making progress, and economic activities in various sectors--commerce, construction, and manufacturing--are on the increase.  some sectors have some problems, but i believe we are going to resolve those problems.    (giron) do you have economic advisers, mr president?    (azcona) any person consulted is an economic adviser.  the main economic advisers, however, are those in the government.    (giron) it is being said that politically speaking you have been left on your own.  is this how you see it also?    (azcona) no way.  how could i be alone? on the contrary, we are doing well.  i believe we are going to receive more support.  i do not see why i could be left alone.  there is the government and the experts.  we are establishing relations with the party, with the most important people of the party.    (giron) are employees going to be pressured?    (azcona) i do not believe they are going to be forced to do anything because no law says that the employees of a government must support any particular party.  however, i believe that if the executive branch works in unison, as it has been doing, then all members of the liberal party will be happy to make contributions to the party to guarantee a new victory.    (giron) would you support reforms to the electoral law?    (azcona) we discussed that issue today.  apparently the national convention, which is the party's top authority, has approved some reforms.    (giron) do you agree with internal elections taking place simultaneously (as heard)?    (azcona) i believe it would be beneficial if they take place in one single day, but we did not discuss that today, and i do not want to discuss details about that.    (giron) do you believe that either your government or yourself could have been politically harmed by the latest crisis endured by the country?    (azcona) i do not think so.  i think that what happened will benefit the country.  acts of violence are regrettable, but those that have taken place have shown that we in honduras are not immune to violence. the same day incidents were taking place here, 13 persons died in san salvador as a result of a bomb explosion.  the loss of lives is unfortunate and violence against a building and facilities next to the u.s. embassy is regrettable because this does not help the country.    (giron) have you talked with u.s. government officials about an indemnity?  it is being said that damage amounts to $6 million.    (azcona) no, we have nothing about $6 million.  what we have received is a note from the u.s. ambassador the day after the incidents.  they are entitled to file a protest.  the note says that later there will be a (words indistinct).    honduras signed the geneva convention on the responsibility of governments when actions are carried out against diplomatic installations.    (giron) the forcing of radio stations to join a radio network and the imposing of a state of emergency have been the source of much criticism against your government.    (azcona) i have heard some criticism because of the network. perhaps we had it for a few hours too many.  regarding the state of emergency, however, the people have responded positively because one more casualty would have had negative effects.  the state of emergency made it possible for people to cool down, and those on the streets returned to their homes.  i feel it was beneficial.  the declaration of emergency decree was based on the constitution and on presidential authority.  congress was informed about this.    i believe this was a positive measure, and this is how the people have viewed it, positively.    (giron) do you believe the situation has been overcome?    (azcona) we do not know if the situation is over.  i think so.  i believe that what happened is that tempers got hot for a moment, and that some sectors, which i do not want to name because they have been identified by the people, took advantage of this.  perhaps some people tried to make political gains and the situation got out of hand.    i believe, however, that everything is more or less quiet.  the government is talking with the various sectors.  there is a small strike by a small group of health workers.  checks with salary increases covering a 4-month period will be paid today.  some readjustments will be made to favor some employees who have not received the increases we had promised.    we want to appeal to health sector labor unions to set aside any confrontational attitude because the government is meeting and will meet all its commitments.    (giron) what can you tell us about the latest incidents with nicaragua?    (azcona) these are not the first incidents.  i believe incidents will continue happening.  however, the government is prepared to enforce respect for the country's sovereignty.  (end recording)",
